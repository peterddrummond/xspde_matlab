@article{Kiesewetter2016xSPDE,
	abstract = {We introduce an extensible software toolbox, xSPDE, for solving ordinary and partial stochastic differential equations. The toolbox makes extensive use of vector and parallel methods. Inputs are exceptionally simple, to reduce the learning curve, with default options for all of the many input parameters. The code calculates functional means, correlations and spectra, checks for errors in both time-step and sampling, and provides several choices of algorithm. Most aspects of the code, including the numerical algorithm, have a modular functional design to allow user modifications.},

@article{Drummond1991Computer,
	abstract = {A class of robust algorithms for the computer simulation of stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise is investigated. Excellent agreement is obtained with the known analytic behaviour of the Kubo oscillator in the white noise limit. The algorithms include a known first-order one-dimensional explicit method, as well as implicit methods of increased stability. A distinction is drawn between classes of stochastic differential equations depending on the type of spatial variation or curvature defined by the diffusion tensor. This allows greatly simplified numerical implementations of the new algorithms in certain cases. The results of different techniques are compared for the case of the Kubo oscillator, where a semi-implicit technique gives the greatest accuracy.},

@article{Werner1997Robust,
	abstract = {A robust semi-implicit central partial difference algorithm for the numerical solution of coupled stochastic parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) is described. This can be used for calculating correlation functions of systems of interacting stochastic fields. Such field equations can arise in the description of Hamiltonian and open systems in the physics of nonlinear processes, and may include multiplicative noise sources. The algorithm can be used for studying the properties of nonlinear quantum or classical field theories. The general approach is outlined and applied to a specific example, namely the quantum statistical fluctuations of ultra-short optical pulses in {\oe}{\'a}(2)parametric waveguides. This example uses a non-diagonal coherent state representation, and correctly predicts the sub-shot noise level spectral fluctuations observed in homodyne detection measurements. It is expected that the methods used will be applicable for higher-order c!
 orrelation functions and other physical problems as well. A stochastic differencing technique for reducing sampling errors is also introduced. This involves solving nonlinear stochastic parabolic PDEs in combination with a reference process, which uses the Wigner representation in the example presented here. A computer implementation on MIMD parallel architectures is discussed.},

	abstract = {The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables.},
