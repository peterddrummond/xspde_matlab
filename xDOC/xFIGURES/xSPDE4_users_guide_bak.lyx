The xSPDE toolbox treats stochastic partial and ordinary differential equations,
 with applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physics
 and quantum technologies.
 It computes statistical averages, including time-step and/or sampling error
 estimation.
 xSPDE can provide higher order convergence, Fourier spectra and probability
 densities.
 The toolbox has graphical output and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistics, as well as weighted, projected, or forward-backward equations.
 It can generate input-output quantum spectra.
 All equations may have independent periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann or
 Robin boundary conditions in any dimension, for any vector field component,
 and at either end of any interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
xSPDE has functions that can numerically solve both ordinary and partial
 differential stochastic equations of any type, obtaining correlations,
 probabilities and averages.
 There are many equations of this type

 in physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, medicine, and finance.
 The toolbox has a core treating stochastic differential equations, with
 averages, probability distributions and full error estimates.
 There are stochastic extensions treating applications to partial differential
 equations, projected equations, quantum stochastic equations, master equations
 and quantum phase-space simulations.

, but the code has general applicability.
 The emphasis in xSPDE is on combining a simple user interface with a wide
 range of useful functions, including the essential features of averaging
 and global error estimates.
 The code enables an efficient use memory and parallelism, which is vital
 for large stochastic models, and it is able to be further extended if needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extensible structure of the code-base permits drop-in replacements of
 the algorithms.
 Different simulations can be carried out sequentially.
 This models different stages in an experiment or simulated environment.
 It can be used with or without noise terms, and can use a range of either
 built-in or user defined integration algorithms.

xSPDE calculates and plots averages and probabilities of arbitrary functions
 of any number of complex or real fields, as well as Fourier transforms
 in time or space with any given dimensionality.
 Importantly, it gives error estimates for both the discretization and sampling
 error, but the algorithm, the step-size and the number of samples used
 is up to the user to control to obtain the required error levels.

\begin_layout Standard
An ordinary stochastic differential equation in one time dimension is,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t}=\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)\cdot\mathbf{w}(t)\,.\label{eq:SDE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is a real or complex vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is a vector function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{B}}$
\end_inset

 a matrix function and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is usually a delta-correlated real Gaussian noise vector such that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle w_{i}\left(t\right)w_{j}\left(t'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(t-t'\right)\delta_{ij}.\label{eq:noise-correlations}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can also have non-Gaussian noise or noise that is not delta-correlated.
 Although these are somewhat less commonly treated, these alternatives are
 often found in real applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Observables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases, there are multiple independent trajectories, and one is interested
 in probabilistic averages, where the unweighted average of an observable
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

 trajectories 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{\left(n\right)}$
\end_inset

 is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \mathbf{O}\right\rangle _{N_{s}} & = & \frac{1}{N_{s}}\sum_{n}\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}^{\left(n\right)}\right).\label{eq:averages-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

In other types of stochastic equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "graham1977path,Drummond2017forward"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, there is a weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 for each trajectory.
 This has an additional equation of motion, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Omega}{\partial t}=A_{\Omega}\left(\mathbf{a},\Omega,t\right)+\underline{B}_{\Omega}\left(\mathbf{a},\Omega,t\right)\cdot\mathbf{w}(t)\,.\label{eq:SDE-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results for all mean values are then weighted by the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(\Omega\left(t\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \mathbf{O}\right\rangle _{\Omega}=\frac{\sum_{n}\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}^{\left(n\right)}\right)\exp\left(\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\left(t\right)\right)}{\sum_{n}\exp\left(\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\left(t\right)\right)}.\label{eq:Weighted-averages-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This expression reduces to the usual average if the weights are zero, i.e,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 Apart from the way that averages are treated, the weight can simply be
 regarded as an additional term in the stochastic differential equations.
 This simply means that one now has an equation with an extra random field,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\rightarrow\left[\mathbf{a},\Omega\right]$
\end_inset

, together with a modified expression for the averages.
 This, in fact, is how these equations are solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reasons of efficiency, it is best to use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 algorithms to treat these numerically.
 This replicates highly weighted trajectories with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\left(t\right)\gg0$
\end_inset

 and removes trajectories with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\ll0$
\end_inset

, that have negligible weight.
 The numerical method is described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The remainder of This chapter will focus on the most commonly treated case
 of unweighted, Gaussian, delta-correlated noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Stochastic calculus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of delta-correlated noise, the trajectories are not differentiable.
 As a result, there are two main variants of stochastic calculus used to
 define the derivatives, called Ito or Stratonovich 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gardiner2009Stochastic,Arnold1992stochastic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and xSPDE can be used for either type.
 The default algorithms are designed for Stratonovich cases, since this
 is just ordinary calculus.
 Ito calculus can be treated also, either using the directly applicable
 Euler method, or else by appropriate transformations to a Stratonovich
 form.
 One can also have a time-reversed or implicit Ito calculus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drummond1991Computer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which is directly solved using an implicit Ito-Euler method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single step in time of duration 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 uses finite noises 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 which are defined to be delta-correlated in the small time-step limit,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w_{i}w_{j}\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}/\Delta t.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Types of stochastic calculus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limits as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 are taken differently for the different types of stochastic calculus.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{0}=\mathbf{a}\left(t_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}=t_{0}+\Delta t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}=\mathbf{a}\left(t_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{a}}=\left(\mathbf{a}_{1}+\mathbf{a}_{0}\right)/2$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{t}=t+\Delta t/2$
\end_inset

\end{equation}

\end_inset

The drift term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is changed in Ito or implicit Ito calculus, if the noise coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 depends on the stochastic variable: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
A_{i}^{(I)} & =A_{i}+\frac{1}{2}B_{jk}\partial_{j}B_{ik},\label{eq:ItovsStratonovichDrift}\\
A_{i}^{(I+)} & =A_{i}-\frac{1}{2}B_{jk}\partial_{j}B_{ik}.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{n}\equiv\partial/\partial a_{n}$
\end_inset

 and we use an Einstein convention of summing over all repeated indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Interaction picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interaction picture allows one to eliminate linear terms in the time
 derivatives.
 It is especially useful for stochastic partial differential equations,
 but it is applicable to stochastic equations as well.
 Suppose there are linear terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{L}}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)=\mathbf{A}_{1}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\cdot\mathbf{a}\,$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{L}}$
\end_inset

 is a constant matrix.
 The interaction picture defines local variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 for the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to introduce an abbreviated notation as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}D\left(\mathbf{a}\right)=\mathbf{A}_{1}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left(\mathbf{a},t\right)\cdot\mathbf{w}(t)\end{aligned}
\end{split}
,\label{eq:deriv_without_linear_term-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that one can write the differential equation as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t}=D\left(\mathbf{a}\right)+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\cdot\mathbf{a}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 This is given formally by:

where

 is the interaction picture origin.
 Transforming the field

 to an interaction picture is achieved on defining: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{a}}=\underline{\mathbf{P}}^{-1}\left(\Delta t\right)\mathbf{a}.

\end_inset

As a result, the equation of motion is: 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin{split}\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{a}}}{\partial t}=D\left(\underline{\mathbf{P}}\left(\Delta t\right)\tilde{\mathbf{a}}\right).\end{split}

This removes linear terms, which can cause stiffness in the equations, increasin

Probability distributions

\begin_layout Standard
Stochastic equations generate trajectories distributed with a probability
 density 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 These can be defined as an average and hence can be evaluated stochastically,
 since: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(\mathbf{a}'\right)=\left\langle \delta\left(\mathbf{a}'-\mathbf{a}\right)\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle ..\right\rangle \equiv\left\langle ..\right\rangle _{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is the infinite ensemble limit of the average over many trajectories.
 The probability can be shown to follow a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) with
 positive semi-definite diffusion matrix,

Distribution averages

\begin_layout Standard
The average of any observable 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 is obtained either by averaging over the stochastic trajectories numerically,
 or by analytic calculations, using: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \mathbf{O}\right\rangle  & = & \int\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)P\left(\mathbf{a}\right)d\mathbf{a}.\label{eq:averages}

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamics of an observable or moment follows an adjoint equation, where
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \frac{\partial\mathbf{O}}{\partial t}\right\rangle =\left\langle \tilde{\mathcal{L}}\mathbf{O}\right\rangle ,\label{eq:moment_equn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \tilde{\mathcal{L}}\mathbf{O}\right\rangle =\left\langle \left[A_{n}^{(I)}\partial_{n}+\frac{1}{2}B_{nk}B_{mk}\partial_{n}\partial_{m}\right]\mathbf{O}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation allows the time-evolution of averages to be calculated analyticall
y in simple cases, given an initial distribution.
 However, in more complex cases, a numerical simulation of the stochastic
 equations is more practical, and this can be carried out with xSPDE or
 other software.

Any function of the stochastic variables has a corresponding probability

 For example, the distribution of

 distribution with a single degree of freedom, such that if 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\left(a-\bar{a}\left(t\right)\right)^{2}/\sigma^{2}\left(t\right)$

\begin_inset Formula

More generally, it is often not known what the exact analytic solutions

Discrete Fourier transforms

\begin_layout Standard
While exact in this analytic case, the definition above is impractical for

 In taking measurements and doing simulations, one has a discrete set of

 Assuming the samples are at fixed intervals, the best one can do in practical

\begin_inset Formula $dt$

then to a good approximation as 
\begin_inset Formula $dt\rightarrow0$

 is not too large, 
\begin_inset Formula

For sufficiently long times, the solution in frequency space - where

 These have the feature that the measured output spectrum may also include
 noise from reflected fields at the input/output ports.
 If the quantum noise term in the Heisenberg equations for a cavity operator

 is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\hat{a}}_{c}\sim..+\sqrt{2\gamma}\hat{a}_{in}(t),$

 then the corresponding operator input-output relations are

\begin_layout Standard
In quantum phase-space for the case of the harmonic oscillator or similar

 Over long time-scales, so that one is in the steady state, the solution

\begin_inset Formula

\tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega) & =\sqrt{2}\left[\frac{1}{1-i\omega}-\frac{1}{2}\right]\tilde{\zeta}(\omega)\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\frac{1+i\omega}{1-i\omega}\right]\tilde{\zeta}(\omega).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives the following expectation values: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle \tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega)\left(\tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega)\left(\omega'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2}\delta\left(\omega-\omega'\right)\nonumber \\
\left\langle \tilde{\alpha}_{in}(\omega)\left(\tilde{\alpha}_{in}(\omega)\left(\omega'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2}\delta\left(\omega-\omega'\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

These are the expectation values of the zero temperature quantum fluctuations
 in the input and output channels.
 This means that the harmonic oscillator in its ground state is in equilibrium
 with an external vacuum field reservoir, also in its ground state.
 However, from Eq

\begin_layout Standard
While this is a simple result, exactly the same general type of behavior
 occurs in more sophisticated cases.
 These may include many coupled modes with nonlinearities.
 Additional or auxiliary fields that depend both on noise terms and internal
 stochastic variables are required.
 The soluble case given above is a useful test case, and it is treated numerical

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\ln(N_{max})$

\begin_inset Formula $N_{max}$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the Hilbert space of a single mode.
 This becomes exponentially difficult to solve numerically as 
\begin_inset Formula $M\rightarrow\infty$

The master equation treated here and elsewhere is repeated for reference
 purposes.
 It has the standard Lindblad form that:
\begin_inset Formula

 & =-i\left[\hat{H},\rho\right]+\sum_{j}\gamma_{j}\left(2\hat{L}_{j}\rho\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}-\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}\hat{L}_{j}\rho-\rho\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}\hat{L}_{j}\right)
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the reversible system Hamiltonian, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{j}$
\end_inset

 are operators that couple the quantum system to the dissipative reservoir,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}$

 is the decay rate.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \hat{O}\right\rangle =Tr\left(\rho\hat{O}\right)

The definitions used here mean that for the case of linear damping with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}=\hat{a}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the amplitude decay rate.
 This abstract notation does not include the effects of finite temperatures,
 which are explained below.

 This is useful for xSPDE inputs, which use standard dimensionless operators.
 Some references combine the rate with the operator

 Some combine

 rate with the operator, defining

Stochastic Schrödinger equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE) is an equation with noise terms
 used to solve a dissipative master equation by random sampling, and was
 originally developed for applications in quantum foundations

.
 It has the advantage over a master equation that for large numbers of modes
 it uses less storage.
 This requires 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\lambda M}$
\end_inset

complex numbers for the  storage of an 
\begin_inset Formula $M-$
\end_inset

mode quantum system, compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim e^{2\lambda M}$
\end_inset

 for the master equation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\log_{e}(N)$
\end_inset

 for an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-level local Hilbert space.
 This is exponentially large, but the memory required is less than with
 a density matrix equation, doubling the number of modes that are accessible.
 The drawback is that many parallel trajectories must be averaged in order
 to give a low final sampling error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An SSE can also be regarded in certain cases as providing a direct simulation
 of the measurement process, which means that the information recorded in
 a simulation is similar to the information measured in a quantum experiment.
 This requires a suitable choice of the method, sometimes called an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unraveling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the stochastic integration algorithm.
 Different unravellings mean different measurements and different convergence
 rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many versions of the SSE, which use different normalization, different
 random noises or different types of stochastic calculus.
 Noises can be real or complex, and either continuous or with discrete jumps.
 These are different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unravellings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and correspond physically to distinct measurement devices and outcomes.
 They also have different sampling errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to phase-space expansions, the SSE method has the problem that
 storage requirements are exponential in the system size, although it may
 have lower sampling errors for high nonlinearities.
 This limits mode numbers to 
\begin_inset Formula $10-50$
\end_inset

, depending on the size of the Hilbert space per mode and the computational
 resources.
 The approach is most useful for small mode numbers, especially for large
 nonlinearities.

For the real noise case, the correction term is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A_{\mu}=A_{\mu}^{(I)}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\sigma\nu}\left(B_{\nu\sigma}\partial_{\nu}+B_{\nu\sigma}^{*}\partial_{\nu}^{*}\right)B_{\mu\sigma},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\mu j}=\sqrt{2\gamma_{j}}\Delta L_{j\mu\beta}\Psi_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Taking 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=\sigma,$
\end_inset

 the conjugate correction is given above and is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 The first term is obtained from differentiation of the noise matrix:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B_{\mu j}=\alpha_{j}\sqrt{2\gamma_{j}}\Delta L_{j\mu\beta}\Psi_{\beta}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

hence one obtains that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu j} & =\sqrt{2\gamma_{j}}\alpha_{j}\left[\Delta L_{j\mu\nu}-\sum_{\beta}\delta_{\mu\beta}\left[\Psi_{\rho}^{*}L_{j\rho\nu}\right]\Psi_{\beta}\right].
\end{align}

\end_inset

The additional correction is as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\nu j}B_{\nu j}\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu j} & =-\sum_{\nu j}\gamma_{j}\alpha_{j}^{2}\left[\Delta L_{j\mu\nu}-\Psi_{\rho}^{*}L_{j\rho\nu}\Psi_{\mu}\right]\Delta L_{j\nu\sigma}\Psi_{\sigma}\nonumber \\
 & =-\sum_{\nu j}\gamma_{j}\alpha_{j}^{2}\left(\Delta L_{j\mu\nu}\Delta L_{j\nu\sigma}\Psi_{\sigma}-\left[\Psi_{\rho}^{*}L_{j\rho\nu}\Delta L_{j\nu\sigma}\Psi_{\sigma}\right]\Psi_{\mu}\right).

Written in operator/wave-function terminology, the real correction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\delta A^{r}\right\rangle $

 & =-\sum_{\nu j}\gamma_{j}\alpha_{j}^{2}\left(\left[\hat{L}_{j}^{2}-2\hat{L}_{j}\left\langle \hat{L}_{j}\right\rangle _{\Psi}+\left\langle \hat{L}_{j}\right\rangle _{\Psi}^{2}\right]-\left\langle \hat{L}_{j}^{2}\right\rangle _{\Psi}+\left\langle \hat{L}_{j}\right\rangle _{\Psi}^{2}\right)\left|\Psi\right\rangle \nonumber \\

\end_inset

Combining both terms, and defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}_{j}=\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}+\alpha_{j}^{2}\hat{L}_{j}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{d\left|\Psi\right\rangle }{dt} & =\left\{ -iH+\sum_{j}\gamma_{j}\left(2\left\langle \hat{X}_{j}\right\rangle _{\Psi}\Delta\hat{L}_{j}-\Delta\left[\hat{X}_{j}\hat{L}_{j}\right]\right)\right\} \left|\Psi\right\rangle \nonumber \\

, given each mode is independent as is the case in optical networks.
 Currently, xQSim can simulate pure and thermalized squeezed states as well
 as classical thermal state inputs into the network.
 This is achieved using a model for thermal squeezed states which alters
 the multi-mode input coherence 
\begin_inset Formula $m(r_{j})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{m}(r_{j})=(1-\epsilon)m(r_{j})$
\end_inset

 whilst keeping the input photon number 
\begin_inset Formula $n(r_{j})=\bar{n}_{j}$
\end_inset

 unchanged.
 This allows users to easily interpolate between thermal, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=1$

Thermal states are classical states with fluctuations larger than the vacuum

\end_inset

\end{align}

\end_inset

In the thermalized case, the relationship between coherence and photon number
 is modified, since to eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 one must use the relationship that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tilde{m}^{2}}{\left(2n_{th}+1\right)^{2}} & =\sinh^{2}\left(r\right)\left(1+\sinh^{2}\left(r\right)\right)\\

\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{m}^{2} & =\left(\bar{n}-n_{th}\right)\left(1+\bar{n}+n_{th}\right)\nonumber \\

\begin_layout Standard
Photonic networks employed as quantum computers aim to sample from an output
 state whose distribution corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\#P$
\end_inset

-hard matrix permanent, Hafnian or Torontonian distributions.
 Which output probability is sampled depends on the input states to the
 network, with Fock states corresponding to the permanent and squeezed states
 corresponding to the Hafnian or Torontonian distributions, where the difference
 between these distributions comes from the detector used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sampled distribution not only depends on the input state but also the
 detector type.
 When photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors are used one samples either
 the permanent, given the input is a Fock state, or the Hafnian distribution
 for a squeezed state input.
 The Torontonian corresponds to the use of saturating, or click, detectors
 with squeezed state inputs.

 From Eq.(

Intensity correlations

\begin_layout Standard
We now explain two types of measurable correlations: Glauber intensity correlati
ons and grouped correlations, also referred to as a grouped count probabilities
 (GCPs).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intensity correlation simulations can only be performed on photon number
 operator observables.
 Therefore, although they are valid for determining photon number probabilities
 in click experiments, they correspond directly to PNR detector outputs.
 Meanwhile GCPs are only valid for click detectors.
 Although methods are available which convert PNR detectors to click detectors,
 direct binning methods for PNR outputs will be included in a sequential

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glauber's 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

G^{(n)}(c_{j})=\left\langle :(\hat{n}'_{j})^{c_{j}}\dots(\hat{n}'_{M})^{c_{M}}:\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\sum c_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the correlation order.
 Multi-mode Glauber correlations determine the probability of detecting
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 photons at 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal ordering requirement causes all creation operators to the right
 and all annihilation operators to the left.
 For example, the second-order correlation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G^{(2)}=\left\langle a_{1}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{2}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{2}^{(\text{out})}a_{1}^{(\text{out})}\right\rangle ,

\end_inset

corresponds to detecting one photon at mode 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and one at mode

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G^{(2)}=\left\langle a_{1}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{2}^{(\text{out})}\right\rangle \left\langle a_{2}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{1}^{(\text{out})}\right\rangle +\left\langle a_{1}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{1}^{(\text{out})}\right\rangle \left\langle a_{2}^{\dagger(\text{out})}a_{2}^{(\text{out})}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first term describes non-local correlations which is the interference
 of photons between detectors, whilst the second term describes the photon
 intensity at a detector or local correlations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the mean number of photons is small, such that a detector will only ever
 observe one photon, the intensity correlation becomes a coincidence count
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grouped correlations

\begin_layout Standard
Grouped count probabilities (GCPs) are the main observable correlation implement

\begin_layout Standard
GCPs are defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol{S}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{m})=\left\langle \prod_{j=1}^{d}\left[\sum_{\sum c_{i}=m_{j}}\hat{\Pi}_{S_{j}}(\boldsymbol{c})\right]\right\rangle ,\label{eq:GCP}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{m}=(m_{1},\dots,m_{d})$
\end_inset

 are the observed grouped counts in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensions and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}=(S_{1,}S_{2},\dots)$
\end_inset

 is a vector of disjoint subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{M}=(M_{1},M_{2},\dots)$
\end_inset

 modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each grouped count is obtained by summing over binary patterns 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{j}=\sum_{i}^{M}c_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, grouped counts contain 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 bins, with each bin corresponding to the total number of clicks in each
 pattern.
 In one-dimension, GCPs are the probability of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 counts in any pattern with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{1,\dots,M\}$
\end_inset

.
 This observable is called total counts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For larger dimensions, each grouped count sums over detector outputs for
 a subset of modes only such that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{j}=\sum_{i}^{M/d}c_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The modes in each subset are denoted in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, in two-dimensions one has subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}=(S_{1},S_{2})$
\end_inset

 which contain modes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
S_{1} & =\left\{ 1,\dots,\frac{M}{2}\right\} \nonumber \\
S_{2} & =\left\{ \frac{M+2}{2},\dots,M\right\} .
\end{align}

\end_inset

The output GCP is then a joint probability of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{M/2}c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}=\sum_{i=M/2+1}^{M}c_{i}$
\end_inset

 grouped counts with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=(M/2+1)^{2}$
\end_inset

 total bins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implied segregation of output modes in the two-dimensional example above
 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 will always contain the first 
\begin_inset Formula $M/d$
\end_inset

 modes, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

 the next 
\begin_inset Formula $M/d+1\rightarrow2M/d$
\end_inset

 modes, and so on for larger dimensions.
 However, there is no practical restriction on the output modes each subset
 can contain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, by randomly permuting each binary pattern we can change the output
 modes that are contained in each subset giving 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\binom{M}{M/d}}{d}=\frac{M!}{d(M/d)!(M-M/d)!},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

possible ways of generating 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1},\dots,m_{d}$
\end_inset

 grouped counts without repeating a specific permutation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $M=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

, including the standard division, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 different orderings of outputs modes with subsets 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{S} & =(S_{1},S_{2})=(\{1,2\},\{3,4\}),\nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{S} & =(S_{1},S_{2})=(\{1,3\},\{2,4\}),\nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{S} & =(S_{1},S_{2})=(\{1,4\},\{2,3\}).
\end{align}

\end_inset

Each permutation generates a different correlation, where we assume the
 commutation of GCP probabilities with subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $(\{1,3\},\{2,4\})=(\{2,4\},\{1,3\})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This permutation only changes the multidimensional GCP simulations, as in
 the total count case all modes are contained in the same subset 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{1,\dots,M\}$
\end_inset

.
 This is also the case when simulating marginal probabilities, which are
 obtained by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $n<M$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $M-n$
\end_inset

 inputs are ignored.
 The first-order marginal, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

, is called the click correlation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{\pi}_{j}(1)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 There are trade-offs, and these techniques often may require further approximat

The advantage of these methods is that the phase-space distribution can

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the Wigner function always exists as a real-valued function on
 phase-space for the density operator, or any other hermitian operator,
 the resulting probability distribution need not be positive.
 This is why the Wigner distribution is referred to as a quasi-probability.
 However for thermal and squeezed states, the Wigner distribution is positive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the positive distribution, the Wigner function is only valid for
 symmetrically ordered operator products.
 Symmetric ordering, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\dots\}_{sym}$
\end_inset

, is the average over all possible combinations of creation and annihilation
 operators, for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\{\hat{a}^{\dagger}a\}_{sym} & =\frac{1}{2}(\hat{a}\hat{a}^{\dagger}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a})\label{eq:sym_number_op}\\
\{\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}^{2}\}_{sym} & =\frac{1}{3}(\hat{a}^{2}\hat{a}^{\dagger}+\hat{a}\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}^{2}).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ordering requirement makes applications to normally ordered detectors
 both cumbersome, as one must reorder all operators to normal order, and
 inaccurate, as seen from Eq.(

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \{\hat{a}^{\dagger}a\}_{sym}\right\rangle =|\alpha|^{2}+\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, the Wigner function adds half a quantum of vacuum noise per mode
 causing a rapid increase sampling errors, making the Wigner function unsuitable
 for simulations of network output probabilities.
 
\end_layout

However, the Wigner function is ideal for simulating squeezed state quadrature
 operators, Eqs.(), as these are measured via homodyne detectors which are

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \dots\right\rangle _{Q}$
\end_inset

 denotes a Q-distribution average.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, like the Wigner function, operators must be reordered for applications
 to normally ordered detectors.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \{a\hat{a}^{\dagger}\}_{anti}\right\rangle =|\alpha|^{2}+1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Q-function adds a quantum of vacuum noise per mode, generating the largest
 increase in sampling errors of any phase-space representation when used
 to simulate normally ordered detectors.
 This accumulation of vacuum noise for multimode networks rapidly causes
 the Q-function to become inaccurate for simulating linear networks.

 This is because a large number is more probable if a jump is observed,

 The opposite behavior is found with a negative relative number

 Every term eventually is in a vacuum state, and no further decay is possible.

Input-output spectra

The spectrum of an internal field variable is not the one that is usually
 measured.
 An important application of stochastic equations is therefore in calculating
 output, measured spectra of lasers, quantum optics, opto-mechanics and
 quantum circuits

 These have the feature that the measured output spectrum may also include
 noise from reflected fields at the input/output ports.
 If the quantum noise term in the Heisenberg equations for a cavity operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{c}$
\end_inset

 is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\hat{a}}_{c}\sim..+\sqrt{2\gamma}\hat{a}_{in}(t),$
\end_inset

 then the corresponding operator input-output relations are 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{out}(t)+\hat{a}_{in}(t)=\sqrt{2\gamma}\hat{a}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In quantum phase-space for the case of the harmonic oscillator or similar
 systems, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{in}=\sqrt{\sigma+\bar{n}}\zeta$
\end_inset

 is the noise term in the Langevin equation.
 The output fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{out}$

 that are measured are given by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\alpha_{out} & =\sqrt{2\gamma}\alpha-\alpha_{in}.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence one must include in the spectrum both the internal mode variables
 and the noise terms themselves.
 Solving for the spectra, one obtains auxiliary fields with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{\alpha}_{in}(\omega) & =\sqrt{\sigma+\bar{n}}\tilde{\zeta}(\omega)\\
\tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega) & =\sqrt{2\gamma}\tilde{a}(\omega)-\sqrt{\sigma+\bar{n}}\tilde{\zeta}(\omega).\nonumber

In summary, it is the output fields that are amplified and measured.
 Hence one must be able to compute the spectra of the output fields for

 These have the additional feature that they include the reservoir noise

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{n}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Over long time-scales, so that one is in the steady state, the solution
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}_{out}$
\end_inset

 is that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega) & =\sqrt{2}\left[\frac{1}{1-i\omega}-\frac{1}{2}\right]\tilde{\zeta}(\omega)\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\frac{1+i\omega}{1-i\omega}\right]\tilde{\zeta}(\omega).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives the following expectation values: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle \tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega)\left(\tilde{\alpha}_{out}(\omega)\left(\omega'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2}\delta\left(\omega-\omega'\right)\nonumber \\
\left\langle \tilde{\alpha}_{in}(\omega)\left(\tilde{\alpha}_{in}(\omega)\left(\omega'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2}\delta\left(\omega-\omega'\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

These are the expectation values of the zero temperature quantum fluctuations
 in the input and output channels.
 This means that the harmonic oscillator in its ground state is in equilibrium
 with an external vacuum field reservoir, also in its ground state.
 However, from Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the internal spectral correlations of the harmonic oscillator are modified
 by the coupling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this is a simple result, the same general type of behavior occurs
 in more sophisticated cases.
 These may include many coupled modes with nonlinearities.
 Additional or auxiliary fields that depend both on noise terms and internal
 stochastic variables are required.
 The soluble case given above is a useful test case, and it is treated numerical
ly later in the manual.

SPDE definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stochastic partial differential equation or SPDE is defined in both time
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and one or more space dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 We suppose there are 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 total space-time dimensions.
 The space-time coordinate is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}=\left(r^{1},\ldots r^{d}\right)=\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)=\left(t,x,y,z,...\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stochastic partial differential equation solved is written in differential
 form as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t}=\mathbf{A}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{r})+\mathbf{L}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]\cdot\mathbf{a}.\label{eq:spde}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\left[a_{1},\dots a_{f}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a real or complex vector field, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is a vector function of fields and space and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{B}}$
\end_inset

 a matrix function.
 The new feature is that terms can now include the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

, which is a differential term in a real space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The exact structure of these terms is important, and not all such equations
 have well-behaved solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many common cases, the noise term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is delta-correlated in time and space: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle w_{i}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)w_{j}\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(t-t'\right)\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)\delta_{ij}.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

One can also have noise with a finite correlation length defined by a noise
 correlation function 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{ij}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)$
\end_inset

 in space so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle w_{i}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)w_{j}\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(t-t'\right)N_{ij}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right).
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

It is even possible to have noise with a finite correlation time.
 Currently, these are not directly treated in xSPDE, although user definitions
 of this are possible by adding a customized noise function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the initial field has a probability distribution.
 In most examples, we suppose that this initial random field distribution
 can be generated as a function of Gaussian distributed initial random fields
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)$
\end_inset

, where: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle v_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v_{j}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)\delta_{ij}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is also possible that the initial random fields are also not
 delta-correlated, so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle v_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v_{j}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =R_{ij}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right).
\end{equation}

Both finite correlation length and delta-correlated noise and random terms
 can be used in xSPDE simulations, with finite correlation lengths defined
 through a Fourier transform method.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{\ell}^{j}=\left(r_{1}^{j},r_{2}^{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 are locations where boundary conditions are enforced.
 There are five types of boundary 
\emph on
combinations
\emph default
 of these for each dimension and field variable.
 Note that the boundary type can change the error stability properties of
 an equation.
 The most general boundaries can only be specified using finite differences
 currently, as the spectral method boundary types are more limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Periodic boundaries can't be combined with other types, as this defines
 both boundaries:

Just as with the derivative term, each of these types can change with dimension
 and field component.
 Specified field or derivative values can be any user-defined functions
 of space, time, and field amplitude or simply have fixed values.
 Currently, all combinations of boundaries can be treated in xSPDE using
 finite difference derivatives.
 Spectral methods are restricted to periodic or zero Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
 conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Spatial grid and boundaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precise location of the boundary at 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{\ell}^{j}$
\end_inset

 is important in solving (S)PDEs, especially if high accuracy is required,
 or if field values at the boundary are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the spatial grid spacing is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 and the number of grid points in a particular dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $points(d)=N$
\end_inset

, then the maximum range from the first to last computed point is 
\series bold
always
\series default
: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}R=(N-1)\Delta x=ranges(d).\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}=\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathbf{r}=\left(\Delta t,\Delta\mathbf{x}\right),$
\end_inset

this means that the space-time points are at: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r_{i}=O_{i}+(i-1)\Delta r_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

There are two distinct spatial boundary locations used in xSPDE, depending
 on the type of boundary conditions specified, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Periodic boundary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to periodicity, the logical boundary location is arbitrary.
 For the default case of a periodic boundary, the indices are arranged as
 though on a circle from 
\begin_inset Formula $1:N$
\end_inset

.
 It is useful to suppose the boundary as at both 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{1}^{j}=r_{1}^{j}-\Delta r^{j}/2$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{2}^{j}=r_{N_{j}}^{j}+\Delta r^{j}/2$
\end_inset

.
 Neither upper or lower logical 'boundary' is at a grid point.
 The effective range of the domain is 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{j}+\Delta r^{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Only the values at 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 points are computed, and one must regard the point where the periodicity
 is enforced as interpolating between the last and first point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dirichlet/Robin boundary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the case of a non-periodic boundary, including Dirichlet, Robin and
 Neumann boundary conditions, the indices are simply in a line from 
\begin_inset Formula $1:N$
\end_inset

.
 The lower and upper lower boundaries are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{1}^{j}=r_{1}^{j}$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{2}^{j}=r_{N_{j}}^{j}$
\end_inset

.
 In some PDE methods the logical boundaries are outside the grid boundaries,
 but that is not the case here.
 Unlike the periodic case, boundaries are enforced at the first and last
 point.
 This is different to what is found in standard trigonometric transform
 software, but this approach allows for a unified and simpler treatment
 of multiple types of algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Multidimensional walk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest example of an SPDE is the multidimensional Wiener process:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{a}=w(t,\mathbf{x})\,.\label{eq:Wiener_process-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has a solution that is identical in appearance to an SDE: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)=a\left(0,\mathbf{x}\right)+\int_{0}^{t}w\left(\tau,\mathbf{x}\right)d\tau.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as for an SDE, this means that the initial mean value does not change
 in time: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle a\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle =\left\langle a\left(0,\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle .\label{eq:Wiener_mean-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there are no spatial derivatives here, boundary values are not important.
 One can regard this as having periodic boundaries, which by the xSPDE conventio
ns means that no boundary conditions are enforced - since periodic boundaries
 do not alter computed values when there are no derivatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variance solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise correlation is non-vanishing from Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:noise-correlations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, so the variance must increase with time: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle a^{2}\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle  & =\left\langle a^{2}\left(0,\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle +\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t}\left\langle w\left(\tau,\mathbf{x}\right)w\left(\tau',\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle d\tau d\tau'\nonumber \\
 & =\left\langle a^{2}\left(0,\mathbf{x}\right)\right\rangle +\delta^{d-1}\left(0\right)\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t}\delta\left(\tau-\tau'\right)d\tau d\tau'.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integrating the temporal delta function gives unity.
 The spatial delta-function is replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Delta V$
\end_inset

 in a discretized lattice calculation at points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{j}$
\end_inset

 with cell volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V=\prod\Delta x_{j}$
\end_inset

, which means that the second moment and the variance both increase linearly
 with time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle a^{2}\left(t,\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)\right\rangle  & =\left\langle a^{2}\left(0,\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)\right\rangle +t/\Delta V.\label{eq:Wiener_mean_square-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability on the lattice for observing lattice field values 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 follows an elementary diffusion equation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{2\Delta V}\sum_{j}\frac{\partial^{2}P}{\partial a_{j}^{2}}\,,\label{eq:FPE-1-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is an example of Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:FPE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 From this equation and using Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:moment_equn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the first two corresponding moment equations in this case are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left\langle a_{j}\right\rangle = & \left\langle \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial a_{j}^{2}}a_{j}\,\right\rangle =0\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left\langle a_{j}^{2}\right\rangle = & \left\langle \frac{1}{2\Delta V}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial a_{j}^{2}}a_{j}^{2}\,\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\Delta V}.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These differential equations are satisfied by the solutions obtained directly
 from the stochastic equations, but as one can see, the coupling between
 the lattice points provides more interesting behavior.
 This requires derivative terms such as Laplacians.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Interaction picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To treat Laplacians, spectral or interaction-picture methods can be very
 efficient, and in certain cases give both much lower errors and much faster
 run-times.
 They do not have the large errors and stability problems of finite difference
 methods, which allows much larger time-steps to be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the algorithm, (S)PDEs often contain terms which are linear in
 the field variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, including derivative operators acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be treated using an 
\shape italic
interaction picture
\shape default
, which leads to dramatically reduced time-step errors and higher stability
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drummond1993Simulation,Werner1997Robust"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the literature on partial differential equations, this is called a spectral
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interaction picture provides a means to solve for linear terms in the
 time derivatives in a very efficient way.
 This is based on introducing local variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 for the field variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 It is convenient for the purposes of describing such interaction picture
 methods to introduce an abbreviated notation as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]=\mathbf{A}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{r})\end{aligned}
\end{split}
\label{eq:deriv_without_linear_term}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]$
\end_inset

 has no explicit space-dependence, we can write the differential equation
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{a}}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]\cdot\boldsymbol{a}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Linear propagator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we define a linear propagator.
 This is given formally by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta t\right)=\exp\left(\Delta t\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]\right)\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=t-\bar{t}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{t}$
\end_inset

 is the interaction picture origin.
 Transforming the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 to an interaction picture is achieved on defining: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{a}}=\mathcal{P}^{-1}\left(\Delta t\right)\mathbf{a}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As a result, the equation of motion is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{a}}}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta t\right)\tilde{\mathbf{a}},t\right].\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows an SPDE to be treated like an SDE, if transformations are used.
 These can be efficiently implemented using Fourier or discrete sine or
 cosine transforms.
 The xSPDE implementation of this currently requires either periodic or
 zero boundary conditions and a diagonal linear operator 
\emph on
L
\emph default
 without space-dependence.
 The linear operator can have any derivative in the periodic case, but only
 even order derivatives in the Dirichlet and Neumann case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As well as the linear term, derivatives and nonlinear functions that are
 not tractable with spectral methods can appear in the residual term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]$
\end_inset

, where they are treated using finite difference techniques.
 As a result, while the interaction picture does not handle all derivative
 terms, it also does not restrict them from being used elsewhere in the
 equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other methods exist in the literature.
 Improved convergence properties are obtained for some problems in a spectral
 picture using an exact solution of a linear part of the drift term 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, or stochastic noise terms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jentzen2009numerical"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, as well as the Laplacian terms.
 The xSPDE code has user-definable functions that can be adapted to include
 these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fourier transforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often useful to transform a field to implement the interaction picture,
 or to extract nonlocal correlation properties in space.
 The Fourier transforms or spectrum definitions used in xSPDE are given
 by the symmetric Fourier transform definition: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{a}(\mathbf{k}) & =\mathcal{F}\left(a(\mathbf{x})\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\left[2\pi\right]^{\left(d-1\right)/2}}\int e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}a(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}\,.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inverse Fourier transform is the function: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
a(\mathbf{x}) & =\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\tilde{a}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\left[2\pi\right]^{\left(D-1\right)/2}}\int e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\tilde{a}(\mathbf{k})d\mathbf{k}\,.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simulations, this is not combined with any time (or space) averaging
 as in the temporal Fourier transforms.
 The reason for this is that the interaction picture transformations must
 be invertible, which is the case for a point-based discrete Fourier transform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Normalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During propagation, we define temporary internal fields 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\right)$
\end_inset

, that are normalized using FFT conventions: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
A\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\right) & =\sum_{j_{2}=1}^{N_{2}}\ldots\sum_{j_{d}=1}^{N_{d}}e^{-i\mathbf{k}_{n}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}}a\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\right)\,\nonumber \\
a\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\right) & =\frac{1}{\prod_{k=2}^{D}N_{k}}\sum_{n_{2}=1}^{N_{2}}\ldots\sum_{n_{D}=1}^{N_{D}}e^{i\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}}A\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\right)\,.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Otherwise, for graphical and output averages, we define Fourier transforms
 using physics and mathematics conventions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{a}\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\right) & =\prod_{d=2}^{D}\left[\frac{\Delta x_{d}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right]\sum_{j_{2}=1}^{N_{2}}\ldots\sum_{j_{d}=1}^{N_{D}}e^{-i\mathbf{k}_{n}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}}a\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\right)\,\nonumber \\
a\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\right) & =\prod_{d=2}^{D}\left[\frac{\Delta k_{d}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right]\sum_{n_{2}=1}^{N_{2}}\ldots\sum_{n_{d}=1}^{N_{D}}e^{i\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}}\tilde{a}\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{n}}\right)\,.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this rescaling is consistent, because 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta x_{d}\Delta k_{d}=\frac{2\pi}{N_{d}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Trigonometric transforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the interaction picture approach, we now consider other types of
 boundary conditions, which we assume here are either a zero field (Dirichlet)
 or a zero derivative (Neumann).
 We will only treat cases of even order derivatives, which do not change
 the trigonometric function.
 Any odd order derivatives are taken to be included in the finite difference
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

) term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the spectral transform method in one space dimension, one uses a trigonometri
c function, 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(kx\right)=T_{1}\sin\left(kx\right)+T_{2}\cos\left(kx\right)$
\end_inset

 to expand as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
a_{i}\left(t,x\right) & =\sum_{n}a_{i,n}(t)T(k_{i,n}x),
\end{align}

\end_inset

The discrete inverse transform allows evaluation at sample points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{i,n}(t)=\sum_{j}a_{i}(t,x_{j})\tilde{T}(k_{n}x_{j}),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The trigonometrical function is defined such that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{x}^{2p}T(kx)=\left(-k^{2}\right)^{p}T(kx).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Propagator solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the propagator equation is now soluble for the sampled points,
 since for each component 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}\cdot a(t,x_{j}) & =\sum_{ijn}\mathcal{L}a_{n}(t)T(k_{n}x_{j}),\nonumber \\
 & =-\sum_{ijnp}L_{p}\left(-k_{n}^{2}\right)^{p}a_{n}(t)T(k_{n}x_{j})).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(t)=\exp\left(\sum L_{p}\left(-k_{n}^{2}t\right)^{p}t\right)a_{n}(0).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an exact solution, provided the initial condition has the given
 expansion.
 There are no approximations made on the transverse derivative.
 Provided the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 values are the same, this propagator is identical for all types of trigonometri
c and Fourier transforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained above in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Boundary-conditions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), there are five types of boundary combinations that are possible in each
 dimension and field component.
 Each has a corresponding xSPDE boundary type and spectral integrator.
 Just as with the derivative term, each of these types can change with dimension
 and field component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, all can be treated in xSPDE using finite differences, and each
 type of boundary has a particular spectral method that preserves the boundary
 requirement.
 In principle, more than one transform can be used.
 It is possible to define the relevant trigonometric transforms to correspond
 to whole symmetries whose boundary is either at a grid point, or half symmetrie
s which are half-way between two grid points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential equations can also have first order terms, which currently
 require using finite differences or periodic boundaries.
 These make use of boundaries at a grid point, in order to compute the relevant
 terms, which means that there is greater compatibility with the finite
 difference methods when the boundaries are at the grid points.
 With this restriction, the available transforms are reduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to compute first-order derivatives with spectral methods,
 but these turn sine transforms into cosine transforms.
 This is not compatible with simple interaction picture transformations,
 except for the periodic case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, spectral transforms can all be implemented using fast FTT, discrete
 sine (DST) or cosine (DCT) transforms, but the trigonometric method to
 be used is specific to the boundary type.
 The definitions used here mostly correspond to the definitions used in
 the FFTW

Transforms and boundaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that there are Dirichlet or Neumann boundaries, then the following
 expansion can be employed in each dimension.
 We only describe one space dimension for simplicity with: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[S_{n}\sin\left(k_{n}x\right)+C_{n}\cos\left(k_{n}x\right)\right]e^{\sum L_{p}\left(-k_{n}^{2}\right)^{p}t},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n},C_{n},S_{n}$
\end_inset

 are chosen to satisfy the initial and boundary conditions.
 Boundaries are taken, for the purposes of explanation, as being from 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=R$
\end_inset

.
 This is not quite the case in the actual code, which can treat arbitrary
 boundary locations due to the use of the optional 
\emph on
origins
\emph default
 input to change the origin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 computational grid-points.
 For the spatial grid (1-based), this corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}=\left(n-1\right)\Delta x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,...,N$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=\frac{R}{N-1}$
\end_inset

 , so we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{N}=R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In carrying out a discrete transform on 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{T}$
\end_inset

 points, using standard trigonometric transform definitions, there may be
 less grid points required, so we may have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{T}\le N$
\end_inset

 if some of the boundary values are defined due to Dirichlet boundaries.
 Internal xSPDE definitions always use the full computational grid range,
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, which 
\emph on
includes
\emph default
 boundary values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An unnormalized inverse results in the original array multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{FT}/2=\left(N-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{FT}=N-1$
\end_inset

 is the FFTW 'logical' size, so our definitions include a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2/\left(N-1\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 Here
\begin_inset Formula $N_{T}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notation in this section is based on the usual discrete sine and cosine
 transform (FFTW) definitions.
 However, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $1-$

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency or momentum grid spacing is defined for all 
\emph on
output
\emph default
 graphs and periodic Fourier transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\Delta k=\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta x}\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the internal momentum grid spacing used can differ from this, depending
 on the transforms used in the interaction picture.
 As explained above in Section (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Spectral-transforms-and"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the internal momenta for trigonometric transforms are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\Delta k=\frac{\pi}{\left(N-1\right)\Delta x}\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is because the xSPDE algorithms allow the use of a sequence of interaction
 pictures.
 Each successive interaction picture is referenced to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{n}$
\end_inset

, for the n-th step starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{n}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}_{I}(t_{n})=\boldsymbol{a}(t_{n})\equiv\boldsymbol{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible to solve stochastic partial differential equations
 in xSPDE using explicit derivatives, but this is less efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A discrete Fourier transform (DFT) using a fast Fourier transform method
 is employed for the interaction picture (IP) transforms used with periodic
 boundaries.
 This is normalized differently to the graphed Fourier transforms, but the
 difference is not computationally significant.
 However, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta k$
\end_inset

 used internally changes with the precise type of trigonometric transform
 used in other cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one dimension, the DFT is usually defined by a sum over indices starting
 with zero, rather than the Matlab convention of one.
 Hence, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{m}=m-1$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}A_{\tilde{n}}=\mathcal{F}\left(a\right)=\sum_{\tilde{m}=0}^{N-1}a_{\tilde{m}}\exp\left[-2\pi i\tilde{m}\tilde{n}/N\right]\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For periodic boundaries, the IP Fourier transform can be written in terms
 of an FFT as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\boldsymbol{A}\left(\boldsymbol{k}_{\boldsymbol{n}}\right)=\prod_{j}\left[\sum_{\tilde{m}_{j}}\exp\left[-i\left(dk_{j}dx_{j}\right)\tilde{m}_{j}\tilde{n}_{j}\right]\right]\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The inverse FFT Fourier transforms divide by the correct factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{j}N_{j}$
\end_inset

 to ensure invertibility.
 Due to the periodicity of the exponential function, negative momenta are
 obtained if we consider an ordered lattice such that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}k_{j} & =(j-1)\Delta k\,\,\,(j\le N/2)\\
k_{j} & =(j-1-N)\Delta k\,\,(j>N/2)
\end{aligned}
.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This Fourier transform is then multiplied by the appropriate factor to propagate
 in the interaction picture, then an inverse Fourier transform is applied.
 While it is not scaled for interaction picture transforms, an additional
 scaling factor is applied to obtain transformed fields in any averages
 for output plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, in the averages 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\tilde{a}_{n}=\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}A_{\tilde{n}'}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the indexing change indicates that graphed momenta are stored from
 negative to positive values.
 For plotted frequency spectra a 
\series bold
positive
\series default
 sign is used in the frequency exponent of the transform to frequency space,
 to agree with common physics conventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Derivatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spectral derivatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For spectral derivatives in the interaction picture, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{x}\left(k\right)$
\end_inset

 to obtain a derivative.
 To explain, one integrates by parts: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}D_{x}^{p}\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}\left(\boldsymbol{k}\right)=\left[ik_{x}\right]^{p}\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}\left(\boldsymbol{k}\right)=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{d/2}}\int d\boldsymbol{x}e^{-i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{x}}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right]^{p}\boldsymbol{a}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right).\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This means, for example, that to calculate a one dimensional space derivative
 in a Fourier interaction picture routine, one uses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{x}\rightarrow D_{x}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\emph on
Dx
\emph default
 is an array of momenta in cyclic order in dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as defined above, suitable for an FFT calculation.
 The imaginary 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is not needed to give the correct sign, as it is included in the derivative
 array.
 In two dimensions, a full two-dimensional Laplacian is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\nabla}^{2}=\nabla_{x}^{2}+\nabla_{y}^{2}\rightarrow D_{x}^{2}+D_{y}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, on inverting the transform 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right]^{p}\boldsymbol{a}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{d/2}}\int d\boldsymbol{x}e^{i\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{x}}\left[D_{x}\left(\boldsymbol{k}\right)\right]^{p}\tilde{\boldsymbol{a}}\left(\boldsymbol{k}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Finite difference derivatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For calculating derivatives using finite differences, the following central
 differencing method is used, away from the boundaries: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nabla_{x}a\left(x_{i}\right)\rightarrow\frac{1}{2\Delta x}\left[a\left(x_{i+1}\right)-a\left(x_{i-1}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{x}^{2}a\left(x_{i}\right)\rightarrow\frac{1}{\Delta x^{2}}\left[a\left(x_{i+1}\right)-2a\left(x_{i}\right)+a\left(x_{i-1}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This raises the question of how to calculate derivatives at the boundary,
 for example at the lower boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(x_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

A typical script first defines parameters and function specifications, in
 a structure, then runs the simulation code with the parameter structure
 as an input, as follows:

Note the following points to remember: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{p.}[label1]=[parameter1]$
\end_inset

 defines a parameter in the structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are many possible inputs, which all have default values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You don't have to save the data if you want an immediate plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{p.deriv=}\mathtt{@(a,w,p)}\,\,[derivative]$
\end_inset

 defines a function, 
\begin_inset Formula $da/dt$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{a}$
\end_inset

 is the stochastic variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{w}$
\end_inset

 the random noise, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 a structure.
 
\end_layout

\emph default

\begin_layout Standard
All xSPDE simulations use a structure for input data.
 Most functions also require a parameter structure, combining the data input
 with additional internal parameters.
 Any naming convention will do for either structure, as long as you are
 consistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User-defined parameters can be added freely.
 To ensure that there is no clash with internal variables, it is best if
 user defined parameters start with a capital letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xSPDE inputs have default values, which are used if the input values
 are omitted.
 If you only need the first element of a vector or array, just input the
 value required.
 Parameters can be output with the verbose switch, 
\family typewriter
p.verbose
\family default
.
 This has four levels of output: 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, with 
\family typewriter
p.verbose=0
\family default
 as default, giving final error reports.
 To get more progress details and individual errors, use 
\family typewriter
p.verbose=1.

\family default
 To eliminate almost everything, use 
\family typewriter
p.verbose=-1.

\family default
 For maximum information, including all the internal parameter values, use;

While this level of detail is not usually needed, it can be useful to print
 out all the internal parameters and default values to understand how the
 program operates.

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ensembles allows multiple trajectories to be integrated.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
observe is a cell array of functions of stochastic fields, each defining
 an average.
 xSPDE expects a (named or anonymous) function that takes two parameters,
 namely the field matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and the input structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 The function must return a real or complex matrix of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(\ell,ensembles(1))$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\ell$

 indexes over a vector observable.
 xSPDE then averages over the second index, to calculate the observable.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
olabels is cell array of graph labels associated with each average, although
 one can also define a function of the averages to be graphed with this
 label.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observables are computed as a two-dimensional packed array, then unpacked
 for storage, giving an array of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(d1,dspacetime,ensembles(1))$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $d1$
\end_inset

 is the local observable dimension, so 
\begin_inset Formula $d1=1$
\end_inset

 for a scalar observable.
 The space-time dimension is 
\begin_inset Formula $dspacetime=1$
\end_inset

 for an SDE, otherwise a vector for a SPDE, and 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(1)$
\end_inset

 is the size of the ensemble of trajectories computed in each processor.
 Once data is averaged internally over 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(1)$
\end_inset

, further transforms of the resulting averages are available.

\begin_layout Subsection
Using the dot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All equations entered in xSPDE utilize the Matlab syntax.
 This is designed to handle scientific or mathematical matrix and array-based
 formulae.
 It has features to simplify matrix or array equations which often require
 a 'dot' or a 'colon'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stochastic variables in xSPDE are matrices or arrays, where the last index
 is used to treat parallel stochastic trajectories, for greater efficiency.
 This requires use of the 'dot' notation to perform multiplication inside
 equations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To multiply vectors, matrices or arrays element-wise, like 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}=b_{ij}c_{ij}$
\end_inset

, the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b.*c$
\end_inset

 indicates that all the elements are multiplied.
 This is used to speed up calculations in parallel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An equation in xSPDE can apply to many stochastic trajectories in parallel.
 Using the dot shortens the equation, and it also means that a fast parallel
 arithmetic will be used.
 The same principle holds for larger arrays with spatial lattices, treated
 in in section

Broadcasting occurs if one or more dimensions has a unit size.
 For example, arrays of size (1,100) and (6,1) can be added or multiplied
 to give a (6,100) matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A formula for a stochastic field may require you to address the first index
 - which is the field component - and treat all the other elements in parallel.
 To do this in a compact way, one may use the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $a(1,:)$
\end_inset

, which indicates that all the subsequent index elements are being addressed
 as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For an an SPDE this can

Probability binning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to graph probability densities of real observables instead
 of averages, if 
\begin_inset Formula $p.ensembles$
\end_inset

 is large.
 This is achieved by inputting the observable number and binning range:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p.binranges\{n\}=\{oa:ostep:ob\};
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If present, this returns probability density of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th observable 
\begin_inset Formula $o\{n\}$
\end_inset

, through binning into ranges of width 
\begin_inset Formula $ostep$
\end_inset

 around the centers of each bin, starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\emph{oa}}$
\end_inset

, and ending at 
\begin_inset Formula $ob$
\end_inset

.
 The simulation returns a result of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/ostep$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $j-th$
\end_inset

 bin if the trajectory is inside the bin, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $o(j)-ostep/2<o<o(j)+ostep/2$
\end_inset

, and zero otherwise.
 This gives a probability density on output, plotted against time.
 Note that on graphing, an extra dimension is added for the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

.
 The probability density at 
\shape italic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multivariate probabilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability density is multivariate for vector observables.
 This is possible because the binning ranges are stored in a cell array,
 which may contain several bin vectors.
 If the observable 
\begin_inset Formula $o\{n\}$
\end_inset

 is two-dimensional, then one can input:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p.binranges\{n\}=\{oa(1):ostep(1):ob(1),oa(2):ostep(2):ob(2)\};

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on

 extra dimensions are added for the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 in this case.
 The graphics program 
\emph on

\emph default
 will attempt to graph them, but it is limited by graphical visualization
 constraints.
 In general, an arbitrary observable dimension is possible, but this is
 also limited by the sampling and memory, since the number of samples per
 bin will decrease rapidly with dimensionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Auxiliary fields and noises
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some problems, it is useful to access the noise terms, or functions of
 the noises and their correlations with the fields at the same time.
 This is handled in xSPDE with auxiliary fields or 
\emph on
auxfields.

\emph default
 These are fields that are functions of noise terms and the integrated fields.
 The number of these is defined in the input structures using the parameter
 
\emph on
p.auxfields,
\emph default
 which is arbitrary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Auxiliary fields are calculated using a function 
\emph on
p.define,
\emph default
 which is similar to 
\emph on
p.deriv
\emph default
, except that it returns the current value of the auxiliary field, not the
 derivative.
 These fields are defined as the 
\emph on
average
\emph default
 over the previous step in time of the auxiliary function.
 This is essential in calculating spectra, in order to eliminate systematic
 errors in Fourier transforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More details on this are given in Section (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Time-domain-spectra"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To access the auxiliary fields, one can compute any observable average
 using a 
\emph on
p.observe
\emph default
 function as usual, or else store the 
\emph on
raw 
\emph default
trajectories including auxiliary fields by setting 
\emph on
p.rawdata=1
\emph default
.
 In either case, the auxiliary fields are appended to the integrated fields
 by adding extra rows to the field matrix.
 The number of variables or matrix rows for inputs to 
\emph on

 or 
\emph on

 is

\begin_layout Standard
The default observe function is used.
 This plots both rows of the field array, including the auxiliary field
 which is defined as the noise term and plotted as a dashed line.
 There is no ensemble averaging, and hence no ensemble error-bars.
 This is simply because because no ensembles were specified in the input
 parameters.
 Similarly, there are no time-step error-bars for this observable, because
 the fine and coarse noises are equal to each other after time averaging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result that is plotted is therefore the coarse noise, whose correlation
 time equals the time step.
 This is plotted below in Fig ( 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-simplest-case: Wiener-2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), which plots the same Wiener process as before, except adding the driving
 noise term as well.
 The standard deviation of the noise in a single step here is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{1/dt}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $1/dt=50/10=5$
\end_inset

 for the default range of 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 and default time points of 
\begin_inset Formula $51.$
\end_inset

 Note that noise terms do not converge at small time-steps for delta-correlated
 noise, even when the integrated stochastic process does converge.
 This is why it is necessary to choose to plot one or the other, or else

To obtain spectra from Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:field-average"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 with greater accuracy, all fields are must be averaged internally.
 The code will use trapezoidal integration in time over the integration
 interval, to give the average midpoint value.
 This employs the same interval for fine and coarse integration, to allow
 comparisons for error-checking.
 After this, the resulting step-averaged fields are then Fourier transformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the simplest case of just one internal step, with no error-checking,
 this means that the field used to calculate a spectrum is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\bar{a}_{j}=\left({a}_{j}+{a}_{j+1}\right)/2,\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which corresponds to the time in the spectral Fourier transform of: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\bar{t}_{j}=\left({t}_{j}+{t}_{j+1}\right)/2.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if any temporal Fourier transform is specified, all the field
 variables are time-averaged over a step.
 This is not strictly necessary, but it means that there is a reduced code
 complexity for cases where there is a Fourier transform for some but not
 all variables.
 As described above, the auxiliary variables are always time-averaged to
 allow error-checking, so there is no change for these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error-checking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an error-checking calculation with two internal 
\emph on
steps
\emph default
, there are three successive valuations: 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j+1/2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j+1}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, for spectral calculations one averages according to: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\bar{a}_{j}=\left(a_{j}+2a_{j+1/2}+a_{j+1}\right)/4.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, one must define the noise terms, both for error-checking and
 for output, since spectral calculations in quantum input-output theory
 include noise terms as well as fields.
 The noise term used to calculate a spectrum involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 A coarse noise term is set equal to the average of two successive fine
 noise terms:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\bar{w}_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(w_{1}+w_{1/2}\right).\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The time integral is carried out numerically as a sum which has 
\begin_inset Formula $N=points(1)$
\end_inset

 time points of interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

.
 In xSPDE, 
\begin_inset Formula $dt=T/(N-1)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $T=ranges(1)$
\end_inset

.
 The effective integration time for the Fourier transform time integrals
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{eff}=Ndt=2\pi/d\omega
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are larger numbers of steps from using the internal 
\emph on

\emph default
 parameter, there are more points to Fourier transform.
 These additional frequencies are computed while carrying out the Fourier
 transform, but only 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 low frequency points are saved.
 The unused high frequency results are not stored or plotted, to conserve
 memory.

 is evidence for a quantum superposition! For experimental comparisons,
 one would measure correlation functions and spectra.

This chapter describes how to use the xSPDE numerical toolbox to solve quantum
 dynamical problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Techniques for master equations and stochastic Schrödinger equations (SSEs)
 are similar to those for an SDE, except for specific equations that generate
 the derivatives, and a projected version of the stochastic method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental master equation solved has the Markovian form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\rho} & =-i\left[\hat{H},\rho\right]+\sum_{j}\gamma_{j}\left(2\hat{L}_{j}\rho\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}-\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}\hat{L}_{j}\rho-\rho\hat{L}_{j}^{\dagger}\hat{L}_{j}\right),
\end{align}

\end_inset

where: 
\begin_inset Formula $j=\left[j_{1},j_{2}(,j_{3})\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{1}$
\end_inset

 is an index that gives the type of damping operator, 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a mode index, and 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{3}$
\end_inset

 is an optional second mode index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Wave-functions and density matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantum toolbox in xSPDE has three methods for representing open quantum
 systems, which allow the treatment of Hilbert spaces of increasing dimensionali
ty:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Density matrices with sparse operators 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stochastic wave-functions with sparse operators 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stochastic wave-functions with functional operators 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a speed/memory tradeoff here.
 The lowest numbered methods are typically faster, but use more memory.
 In the second two cases, one can use either a method using functions for
 operators, or else a sparse matrix method, which requires the operators
 to be stored in memory.
 The wave-function equations describe decoherence through stochastic methods,
 so each of these two approaches can treat coupling to reservoirs, up to
 the limits of time and memory constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using sparse methods, the multimode index 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{n}$
\end_inset

 is packed into the first single index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 This is automatic for density matrices, but it is optional for stochastic
 wave-function calculations, which can use either sparse or full vectors.
 While sparse methods are useful for storing operators, these require memory,
 which must be allocated when the matrices are generated.
 This can be minimized by only generated the operators that are needed,
 rather than all possible ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Less memory is required if the operators' effect on the wave-function are
 calculated only when needed.
 This is a function call strategy, It is currently available for stochastic
 wave-function calculations only.
 It is slower than using sparse matrices, but it is more scalable.
 Currently, this approach is not available for density matrix equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These different approaches therefore have areas of applicability that depend
 on the Hilbert space dimension, as explained below.

 Operators are treated as sparse matrices.
 Due to the storage requirements of a density matrix, this uses the most
 memory, and is the fastest.
 There is no vector ensemble here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Independent cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one wishes to combine results from independent quantum systems, or from
 classical and quantum subsystems, the relevant parameters can be input
 as successive cell variables, together with any other toolbox inputs that
 are required.
 This allows, as an example, implementation of the Maxwell-Bloch equations,
 togther with arbitrary numbers of independent quantum systems like molecules
 and atoms.

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in the examples.
 For example, to specify a quantum wave-function method, one would use 
\begin_inset Formula $quantum=1$

 The input parameters can be chosen not just in terms of the problem itself,
 but also to suit the computational hardware that is available.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
operator: If

There are four types of possible outputs.
 The 
\emph on
observe
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
compare
\emph default
 functions are computed during the time-evolution, so that the entire wave-funct
ion doesn't need to be stored in time, reducing the storage needs.
 Additional functional transformations for either can be used as well, called
 
\emph on
output
\emph default
 functions.
 Finally, a 
\emph on
compare
\emph default
 function allows comparison plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
observe is a cell array of 
\emph on

SSE derivative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSE derivative terms are calculated from two distinct derivative subroutines
, which are 
\begin_inset Formula $SSElinear(a,w,p)$
\end_inset

 for solving the linear SSE, Eq (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:linear_SSE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), and 
\begin_inset Formula $SSE(a,w,p)$
\end_inset

 for solving the nonlinear SSE, Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonlinear SSE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Note that SSE is the default if this is not specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are specified in the nonlinear equation case by the input of: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.deriv=@SSE
\]

\end_inset

 or, for the linear case, which is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 recommended except for tutorial purposes(!)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These correspond to normalized and un-normalized wave-functions.
 The equation can be solved by any 
\begin_inset Formula $method$
\end_inset

 for a Stratonovich SDE.
 For SSE, typically the lowest errors are obtained using an RK4 Schrödinger
 method with projective normalization, @RK4S.

Solving with the MCWF method 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time step in the numerical simulation with the MCWF method, the
 jump probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P$
\end_inset

 is first calculated.
 This is carried out by computing the jump probability per unit time of
 each jump operator 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}$
\end_inset

 in the master equation, which is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta P_{m}=2\gamma_{m}\langle\psi(t)|L_{m}^{\dagger}L_{m}|\psi(t)\rangle\,.\label{eq:individual_jump_prob-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculated jump rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{m}$
\end_inset

 is then compared with a uniform, randomly generated number 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{m}$
\end_inset

 between zero and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{m}>r_{m}$
\end_inset

, the state then undergoes the given jump.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, a jump in any given step become increasingly rare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this, the state vector evolves according to the non-hermitian Hamiltonian
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{eff}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:non-Hermitian_Hamiltonian"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle=-iH_{eff}|\psi(t)\rangle\label{eq:ODE-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This differential equation is solved by a RK4S algorithm, or others that
 are available.
 These steps are repeated till the final time step, and they constitute
 a single trajectory.
 Many trajectories are taken to compute the expectation values for the observabl
es of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For error-checking, fine step results are checked against a coarse step
 with a noise given by 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{c}=\min\left(r_{1},r_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, so that the coarse jump occurs if a jump takes place in either fine step.
 This allows errors due to step-size to be accurately estimated by comparing
 the fine and coarse step-size results, just as with continuous noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MCWF algorithm described above is carried out simply by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $p.jump=1$
\end_inset

.
 No further inputs from the user are required.
 All other parameters are input exactly the same way as in the SSE numerical
 simulation.

Phase-spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple phase-space methods available.
 These include the classical Wigner, Husimi and Glauber representations,
 as well as the positive-P and gauge methods.
 These are generally applicable to large Hilbert spaces as well as small
 ones.
 They have other limitations, and the reader is referred to the original
 literature to obtain further explanations of these methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These different approaches therefore have areas of applicability that depend
 on the Hilbert space dimension, as explained below.

\begin_layout Standard
Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $dimensions>1$
\end_inset

 defines an (S)PDE as opposed to an ordinary (S)DE.
 Here the cell index 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 indicates a field index, and the cell index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gives the observable output or graph index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the xSPDE implementation, the total space-time 
\emph on
dimensions
\emph default
 is unlimited, although, large space-time dimensions become memory-intensive
 and slow.
 There is a practical limit of about ten space-time dimensions with current
 digital computers, unless you have a very large, fast computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SPDE spatial lattice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stochastic variables in an SPDE are stored in a real or complex array, 
\begin_inset Formula $a(i,\mathbf{\ell},e)$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the internal field index, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\ell}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $d-1$
\end_inset

 dimensional spatial lattice index for 
\emph on
d
\emph default
 space-time dimensions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is the ensemble index.
 To specify the spatial lattice, one must define: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dimensions The dimensionality in time and space.
 The default is an SDE: 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
points The number of integration points.
 The default is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{N}=[51,35,35..]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ranges The integration ranges in each dimension.
 The default is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}=[10,10,10..]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
origins The origins of the space-time integration domains.
 By default, the origin is 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(1\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for the time coordinate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{O}=-\mathbf{R}/2$
\end_inset

 for the space coordinates (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $ranges$
\end_inset

 variable) such that the spatial grid is symmetric around 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Initial conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial conditions are set at the initial time of 
\begin_inset Formula $t=O_{1}$
\end_inset

 with a user-defined function so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a(O_{1})=initial(v,p)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\emph on
initial
\emph default
 function includes initial random fields 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left[v^{x},v^{k}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Their correlations are either delta correlated or spatially correlated.
 To allow this, the input parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms$
\end_inset

 is a vector such that: 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms(1)$
\end_inset

 is the number of delta-correlated random fields, 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{x}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms(2)$
\end_inset

 is the number of correlated random fields, 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 All random fields in the 
\emph on
initial
\emph default
 function, even if correlated using filters in momentum space, are transformed
 to position space before use.
 If there is no filtering, 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}$
\end_inset

 have the same correlations.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system has one spatial dimension, or 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

 space-time dimensions, one field and one noise variable.
 We suppose that the initial noise variance is Gaussian, with: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a(0,x)=10v(x).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We want to consider 
\begin_inset Formula $10,000$
\end_inset

 stochastic trajectories per sub-ensemble with
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 sub-ensembles.
 We will set the origin for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 The variable 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 will be initialized as delta-correlated in space with a gaussian standard
 deviation on the lattice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=10/\sqrt{\Delta V}$
\end_inset

.
 As our observable, we consider the second moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

The variances are larger than they would be in the SDE case, where one might
 expect an initial variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle a^{2}(0)\right\rangle =100$
\end_inset

.
 The reason for this is that the initial noise random and noise fields are
 replaced by a lattice with a variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Delta V$
\end_inset

.
 In the default case, this causes an increase in the local noise.

\begin_layout Section
Transverse lattice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $deriv$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $initial$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $observe$
\end_inset

, the field and noise variables 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 now have extended dimensionality compared to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

-dimensional case, to index the transverse lattice.
 The indices are 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(f,\mathbf{i},e\right)$
\end_inset

, where the: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
field index 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the field index for 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and the noise index for

\begin_layout Description
intermediate indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{i},$
\end_inset

 which are absent in the 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

-dimensional case, correspond to the spatial grid and have the same structure.
 For example, in the case with 
\emph on

\emph default
, indicating one time index and two spatial dimension, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{i}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the two space indices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
last index 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the stochastic trajectory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For storing space coordinates like 
\begin_inset Formula $p.x$
\end_inset

, the first and last index are 
\begin_inset Formula $f=e=1$
\end_inset

.
 Where Fourier transforms are used internally, the momentum arrays have
 zero momentum as the first index to follow standard discrete Fourier transform
 conventions.
 This is changed to a symmetric convention in all stored graphics data outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the general equation solved can be written in differential form as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t}=\mathbf{A}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}(t)+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a}\right]\,.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear function 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 can be input either inside the derivative function using finite difference
 operators described below, or as a separate 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 function, to allow for an interaction picture in which case: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\mathbf{\nabla},\mathbf{a}\right]=\,\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\mathbf{\nabla}\right]\mathbf{a}\,.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This depends on momentum space coordinates, which involves Fourier transforms
 and means that no space dependence is allowed.
 Spectral methods in xSPDE are currently restricted to cases with linear
 derivative terms and periodic or zero boundary conditions.
 It is also possible to use finite differences, in which case the derivative
 terms are included as part of the derivative function 
\emph on
deriv
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usual FFT spectral methods require periodicity.
 The four other boundary methods can currently only be used with the default
 boundary values of zero, and with an interaction picture derivative that
 only has even powers of derivatives.
 Additional spectral methods will be included in a subsequent release: xSPDE4.

\begin_layout Standard
The field

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 All parameters are preceded by the parameter structure label.
 Likewise, for higher dimensional problems, the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 exist.
 These are placeholders for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\{1\},r\{2\},r\{3\}$
\end_inset

, so the spatial variables of even higher dimensional problems can be accessed
 through 
\begin_inset Formula $r\{n\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a linear operator in an SPDE gives better accuracy, and allows use
 of the interaction picture.
 This is included automatically for all built-in xSPDE algorithms, provided
 the 
\emph on

 Variables 
\begin_inset Formula $p.D\{i\}$
\end_inset

 (with placeholders 
\begin_inset Formula $p.Dx,p.Dy,p.Dz$
\end_inset

 for the first 3 spatial dimensions) provide access to the derivative operator.
 Higher-order derivatives are found through potentiating 
\begin_inset Formula $p.Dx$
\end_inset

 accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}
\end{equation}

\series bold

 which are used to calculate observables for plotting.
 They operate in parallel over the lattice dimensions, by taking a vector
 or scalar quantity, for example a single field component, and returning
 an average or a space integral.
 In each case the first argument is the field, the second argument is a
 vector defining the type of operation, and the last argument is the parameter
 structure.
 If there are two arguments, the operation vector is replaced by its default
 value.

One space-dimensional example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A famous partial differential equation is an exactly soluble equation for
 a soliton, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{da}{dt}=\frac{i}{2}\left[\nabla^{2}a-a\right]+ia\left|a\right|^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together with the initial condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $a(0,x)=sech(x)$

, this has a soliton, an exact solution that doesn't change in time: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
a(t,x) & = & sech(x).
\end{eqnarray}

The spatial integral is simply: 
\begin_inset Formula

Finite differences

Instead of using the interaction picture, xSPDE also has finite difference
 methods for direct differentiation.
 These derivatives are obtained through function calls

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D2$
\end_inset

 respectively for first and second derivatives, which use a fixed grid spacing.
 As elsewhere, they can be replaced by user-written functions if preferred.
 Generally they require smaller steps in time than spectral methods, when
 used to define the derivative.

\begin_layout Section
Boundary conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transverse boundaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transverse boundary conditions must be given for all partial differential
 equations.
 Common transverse 
\emph on
boundary types
\emph default
 are of three types: Neumann (specified derivative), periodic, or Dirichlet
 (specified field).
 These are obtained using 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}=-1,0,1$
\end_inset

, which is specified for each space dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d>1$
\end_inset

, field index and boundary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\emph on
boundaries
\emph default
 are omitted for any dimension the default is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, which gives periodic boundaries in that dimension for all field indices,
 and permits the use of Fourier transforms and an interaction picture as
 described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix whose column index 
\begin_inset Formula $(i)$
\end_inset

 is the field index, and whose row index (j) is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2$
\end_inset

 for the lower and upper boundary type respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spatial derivatives or other functions linking different spatial points
 can be specified either in the functionals 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{r}\right]$
\end_inset

 or else in the 
\begin_inset Formula $linear$
\end_inset

 function, provided the derivative terms are linear functions of the fields.
 Use of the 
\begin_inset Formula $linear$
\end_inset

 function allows an interaction picture algorithm, with increased efficiency.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $linear$
\end_inset

 function is currently only available with periodic boundary conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default boundary conditions are periodic.
 The implicit setting of this is that periodicity is enforced such that
 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(o_{i}-dx_{i}/2\right)=a\left(o_{i}+r_{i}+dx_{i}/2\right)$
\end_inset

 , which is the usual discrete Fourier transform requirement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, the differential equation boundaries are specified at 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(o_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(o_{i}+r_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, using the cell-array input 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,j)$
\end_inset

, which is defined per space dimension (
\begin_inset Formula $d=2,3..$
\end_inset

), field index (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2..$
\end_inset

) and boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $j=(1,2)$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $d>1$
\end_inset

 is the transverse dimension, not including time, which only has an initial
 condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary the available boundary types are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Neumann: For specified 
\emph on
derivative
\emph default
 boundaries, 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,j)=-1$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Periodic: For 
\emph on
periodic
\emph default
 boundaries, 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,j)=0$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Dirichlet: For specified 
\emph on
field
\emph default
 boundaries, 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,j)=1$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are specified in a cell array: 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,1)$
\end_inset

 sets the lower boundary type in dimension 
\emph on
d
\emph default
, for the 
\emph on
i -th 
\emph default
field component
\emph on
 
\emph default
while 
\begin_inset Formula $boundaries\{d\}(i,2)$
\end_inset

 gives the upper boundary type.
 Each space dimension, variable and boundary is set independently.
 In xSPDE, the equations are always initial value problems in time, so the
 time dimension boundary specification for 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 is not included.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose there are two fields, and we wish to set mixed boundaries in space,

\begin_layout Subsection
Transverse boundary values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-vanishing, specified boundary conditions, the boundary value can
 be entered using 
\begin_inset Formula $boundval(a,p)$
\end_inset

, or else, if it is dynamical, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $boundfun(a,p)$
\end_inset

 is called.
 This returns the boundary values used for the fields or derivatives in
 a particular dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d>1$
\end_inset

 as an array of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $b(\mathbf{j},e))$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}=i,\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $i=j_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the field index, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is the space index, where 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{d}$
\end_inset

 is the index of the dimension whose boundary values are specified.
 For this dimension, only two values are needed: 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{d}=1,2$
\end_inset

 for the lower and upper boundary values, which could either be field values
 or their derivatives.
 An ensemble index 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is also needed if the boundary values are stochastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boundary values can be a function of both the fields (
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

) and internal variables like the current time (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

).
 These may have stochastic initial values at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 which are calculated only once.
 In such cases the boundary values must first be initialized, so the routine
 
\begin_inset Formula $boundfun(a,p)$
\end_inset

 is first internally initialized with time 
\begin_inset Formula $t<origin(1)$
\end_inset

, and with random Gaussian values in the input field 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 These are delta-correlated in space, i.e., with the same definition as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inrandoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The xSDPE program stores the returned values 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 for the boundaries in an internal cell array, 
\begin_inset Formula $boundval\{c,d\}$
\end_inset

, for later use if required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default boundary value is zero, if not specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

NOTE: Current xSPDE code requires finite-difference methods to be used with

\end_inset

 in field variable 1, and Neumann for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and Dirichlet for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 in field variable 2, that are different from the default values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x}a=0$
\end_inset

, so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
a_{1}\left(x=0\right) & =1,\nonumber \\
\partial_{x}a_{1}\left(x=1\right) & =a_{1}\left(x=1\right).\nonumber \\

Output transforms

\begin_layout Standard

 points using a discrete Fourier transform at the lattice points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

, so that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{a}(\omega_{i},\mathbf{k}_{i})=\frac{dtd\mathbf{x}}{\left[2\pi\right]^{d/2}}\sum_{j_{1}\ldots j_{d}}\exp\left[i\left(\omega_{i_{1}}t_{j_{1}}-\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\right)\right]a(t_{j_{1}},\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}})\,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The momenta 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 have an interval of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dk_{i}=\frac{2\pi}{n_{i}dx_{i}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$

 values given for even n by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{i}=\left(1-\frac{n_{i}}{2}\right)dk_{i},\ldots\frac{n_{i}}{2}dk_{i}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
Once Fourier transformed, the

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $k=-k_{max},\ldots$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Initial random fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourier transforms are available for use both on initial random values and
 on noise fields during time-evolution.
 This is controlled by the second element of 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $noises$
\end_inset

, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms(1)>0$
\end_inset

, an initial random field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{x}$
\end_inset

 is generated with delta-correlations in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-space.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $randoms(2)>0$
\end_inset

, an initial random field 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{k}$
\end_inset

 is generated with delta-correlations in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-space.
 This can be filtered with a user-specified filter function to give 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{kf}$
\end_inset

, then inverse Fourier transformed to give 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Both random fields are passed to the 
\begin_inset Formula $initial$
\end_inset

 function as an extended vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[v^{x},v^{k}\right]$
\end_inset

, for field 
\emph on
initialization
\emph default
 in space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a user specified filter function available, to modify random fields
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}^{k}$
\end_inset

, that are delta-correlated in momentum space using a filter function, '
\emph on
rfilter
\emph default
' so that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{kf}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)=f_{i}^{(r)}\left(\mathbf{v}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, before being used.
 The corresponding correlations are: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle v_{i}^{x}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v_{j}^{x}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)\delta_{ij}\sim\frac{1}{\Delta V}\delta_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}'}\delta_{ij}\nonumber \\
\left\langle \tilde{v}_{i}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\tilde{v}_{j}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}'\right)\delta_{ij}\sim\frac{1}{\Delta K}\delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}\delta_{ij}\nonumber \\
\left\langle \tilde{v}_{i}^{kf}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\tilde{v}_{j}^{kf}\left(\mathbf{k}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \left\langle f_{i}^{(r)}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\right)f_{j}^{(r)}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}'\right)\right)\right\rangle .
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that on a lattice, we replace the Dirac continuous delta-function by
 a discrete Kronecker delta function scaled by an inverse volume element
 either in space (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

) or momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta K$
\end_inset

) .
 The xSPDE Fourier transforms are given by a symmetric Fourier transform,
 so that if we inverse Fourier-transform the 
\begin_inset Formula $k-$
\end_inset

space 
\emph on
inrandoms
\emph default
, without filtering, then: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v^{k}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\left[2\pi\right]^{(d-1)/2}}\int e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}\tilde{v}^{k}(\mathbf{k})d\mathbf{k}\,
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These have random initial values that are real and delta-correlated in space,
 so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle v^{x}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v^{x}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The corresponding noises in position space are correlated according to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle v^{k}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\left(v^{k}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\left[2\pi\right]^{(d-1)}}\int e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{k}'\cdot\mathbf{x}')}\left\langle \tilde{v}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\tilde{v}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}'\right)\right\rangle d\mathbf{k}d\mathbf{k}'\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{\left[2\pi\right]^{(d-1)}}\int e^{i(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\cdot\mathbf{k}}d\mathbf{k}\nonumber \\
 & =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

Similarly, if we don't conjugate the k-noise, then: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle v^{k}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v^{k}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{x}'\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}^{c}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)=\left[\tilde{v}_{1}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)+i\tilde{v}_{2}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\right]/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 , then we obtain complex noise that is only delta correlated when conjugated.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle v^{c}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\left(v^{c}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right)^{*}\right\rangle  & =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)\nonumber \\
\left\langle v^{c}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v^{c}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle  & =0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

This is obtainable with the x-space noise as well, but the utility of the
 k-space noise is that it can be filtered to have nonlocal correlations
 in space if required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During propagation in time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}=\left[\mathbf{w}^{x},\mathbf{w}^{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 are real noise fields that are delta-correlated in space-time.
 They are calculated in an analogies way, except with an additional factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{dt}$
\end_inset

 because they are delta correlated in time as well.There is a user specified
 scaling function available, to take random noises 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{k}$
\end_inset

 in momentum space that are then scaled using a filter function, '
\emph on
nfilter
\emph default
' so that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}^{kf}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)=f_{i}^{(n)}\left(\mathbf{w}^{k}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, before being used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}

\begin_layout Section
Scanned parameter plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since xSIM is a function that can be called, plots of results against simulation
 parameters are possible.
 This requires repeated calls to xSIM with different parameter values, together
 with data storage in an xGRAPH compatible form, and a call to xGRAPH.
 If different random seeds are required, the seed needs to be reset in each
 call.
 The relevant axes points plotted, labels and the values of scanned parameters
 also need to be input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation function xSIM uses the last data array index, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, to store the data values and up to two corresponding errors.
 This takes up three index values.
 A value of 
\begin_inset Formula $c=4$
\end_inset

 is used to store comparison data, and its errors if there are any in 
\begin_inset Formula $c=5,6$
\end_inset

.
 This can be used for exact results, approximations, or experimental data.

 Suppose that

\begin_inset Formula $n_{x(y)}$

 points in the x(y)-direction, so then:

\begin_layout Standard
In the simulations, two planar noise fields are propagated, one using delta-corr
elated noise, the other with noise transformed to momentum space to allow
 filtering.
 This allows use of finite correlation lengths when needed, by including
 a frequency filter function that is used to multiply the noise in Fourier-space.
 The Fourier-space noise variance is the square of the filter function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first noise index, 
\begin_inset Formula $p.noises(1)$
\end_inset

, indicates how many noise fields are generated, while 
\begin_inset Formula $p.noises(2)$
\end_inset

 indicates how many of these are spatially correlated, via Fourier transform,
 filter and inverse Fourier transform.
 These appear to the user as additional noises, so the total is 
\begin_inset Formula $p.noises(1)+p.noises(2)$
\end_inset

.
 The filtered noises have a finite correlation length.
 They are correlated with the first 
\begin_inset Formula $p.noises(1)$
\end_inset

 x-space noises they are generated from, as this can be useful.

\begin_layout Standard
In calculations, it is best to use a dimensionless form by rescaling coordinates

 A simple way to simulate this with xSPDE is to treat

 and to assume the random potential field 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 as caused by interactions with second random field 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a(2)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 This has the advantage that it is similar to the actual experiment and
 allows one to treat time-dependent potentials as well, if desired.

Introduction to algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stochastic, partial and ordinary differential equations are central to numerical
 mathematics.
 Ordinary differential equations have been known in some form ever since
 calculus was invented.
 There are an extraordinary number of algorithms used to solve these equations.
 This chapter provides an overview of the included algorithms.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 xSPDE has six built-in choices of algorithm, with defaults.
 All built-in methods have an interaction picture and can be used with any
 space dimension, including 
\begin_inset Formula $dimensions=1$
\end_inset

, which is an ordinary stochastic equation.
 All can be used with stochastic or with non-stochastic equations, and with
 order extrapolation.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 For stochastic equations, the Euler method requires an Ito form of stochastic
 equation, the implicit Euler method requires an implicit Ito form, while
 the others should be used with the Stratonovich form of calculus.
 Each is chosen to be able to use an interaction picture to take care of
 exactly soluble linear terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default methods will solve most DE, SDE, PDE and SPDE problems reliably,
 but other ones can be included if needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Standard methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard xSIM algorithms given below are available for ODEs, PDEs, SDEs
 and SPDEs.
 More advanced algorithms for specialized cases are described in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For stochastic differential equations, which are non-differentiable, the
 usual rules of calculus do not apply because stochastic noise is non-differenti
able.
 It has fluctuations proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{dtdV}$
\end_inset

, for noise defined on a lattice with temporal cell-size 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 and spatial cell-size 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the usual differentiability and smoothness properties required to
 give high-order convergence for standard Runge-Kutta methods are simply
 not present.
 Instead, xSPDE has a built-in extrapolation to zero step-size for high-order
 stochastic convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many more complex higher order algorithms for stochastic integration exist
 but are not included in the current xSPDE distribution, and users are encourage
d to contribute their favorite methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note here that there are multiple error sources possible.
 SDE/SPDE errors are often dominated by the sampling error, not discretization.
 In addition, all convergence theorems only apply to the limit of zero step-size.
 One may be very far from this regime in a given practical calculation.
 Analytic error estimates also have prefactors which are hard to calculate.
 However, xSPDE can numerically estimate both the discretization and sampling
 error for any given average observable.

Some of the more advanced features of the libraries require additional input
 parameters.
 In particular: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
backfields is used for forward-backward stochastic equations, describing
 backward time components.
 These are described in the 
\emph on
Forward-backward
\emph default
 section.
 Note that 
\series bold
fields
\series default
 is still used, and it gives the total number of forward+backward fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
auxfields gives the number of auxiliary fields.
 These have a functional definition (
\emph on
defines
\emph default
) that includes both a field and noise variable, as needed for spectral
 observables.
 Cell index numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 greater than the maximum field cells access the auxiliary fields in the
 
\emph on
observe
\emph default
 function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
General differential form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general equation treated is given in differential form as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{a}}{\partial t}=\boldsymbol{A}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla},\boldsymbol{a},t\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla},\boldsymbol{a},t\right]\cdot\boldsymbol{\zeta}(t)+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]\cdot\boldsymbol{a}.\end{split}
\label{eq:Standard xspde SDE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is convenient for the purposes of describing interaction picture methods,
 to introduce an abbreviated notation as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a},t\right]=\boldsymbol{A}\left[\boldsymbol{a},t\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}\left[\boldsymbol{a},t\right]\cdot\boldsymbol{\zeta}(t).\end{aligned}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, we can rewrite the differential equation in the form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{a}}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a},t\right]+\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]\cdot\boldsymbol{a}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Linear propagator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we define a linear propagator.
 This is given formally by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta t\right)=\exp\left(\Delta t\underline{\mathbf{L}}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\right]\right)\end{split}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Typically, but not necessarily, this is evaluated in Fourier space, where
 it should be just a diagonal term in the momentum vector conjugate to the
 transverse space coordinate.
 It will then involve a Fourier transform, multiplication by an appropriate
 function of the momentum, and then an inverse Fourier transform afterwards.
 For simplicity, the stochastic noise is assumed constant throughout the
 interval 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

.
 The reader is referred to the literature for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is simple to add your own algorithm if you prefer a different one.
 Note that if they use an interaction picture, then 
\emph on
ipsteps
\emph default
 must be given explicitly to specify the interaction picture duration, where
 
\emph on
ipsteps
\emph default
 gives the number of sequential propagator steps in time required for the
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Standard
The standard methods are listed below.
 All of these can be used with any equation: ODE, SDE, PDE or SPDE, either
 with or without a linear interaction picture term.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 This is an explicit Ito-Euler method using an interaction picture.
 While traditional, it is not generally recommended.
 If it is used, very small step-sizes will generally be necessary to reduce
 errors to a usable level.
 This is because it is is only convergent to first order deterministically
 and tends to have large errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 It requires one IP transform per step (

\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{n+1}=t_{n}+\Delta t$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}\Delta\mathbf{a}_{n} & =\Delta t\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a}_{n},t_{n}\right]\\
\mathbf{a}_{n+1} & =\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta t\right)\cdot\left[\mathbf{a}_{n}+\Delta\mathbf{a}_{n}\right]

 This is a fully implicit Ito-Euler method using an interaction picture.
 It is more robust, though slower, than the explicit form.
 If it is used, very small step-sizes will generally be necessary to reduce
 errors to a usable level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is because it is is only convergent to first order, and therefore tends

 It is designed for use with an implicit Ito form of stochastic equation.

: Midpoint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "algorithms:midpoint"

\end_inset

 This is a semi-implicit midpoint method using an interaction picture.
 It gives good results for stochastic and stochastic partial differential
 equations.
 It is convergent to second order in time for deterministic equations and
 for stochastic equations with commuting noise.
 It is strongly convergent and robust.
 It requires two half-length IP transforms per step (
\begin_inset Formula $p.ipsteps=2$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the next time point, one calculates a midpoint derivative iteratively
 at time to get the next time point at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{n+1/2}=t_{n}+\Delta t/2$
\end_inset

, to give an estimated midpoint field 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{a}}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

, usually with four iterations.
 The number of iterations can be changed: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}\bar{\mathbf{a}}^{(0)} & =\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\cdot\left[\mathbf{a}_{n}\right]\\

 This is an implicit midpoint method using an interaction picture, together
 with an adaptive technique for integrating highly nonlinear equations.
 At low amplitudes it is identical to the standard midpoint method.
 For amplitudes 
\begin_inset Formula $|a_{i}|^{2}$

 for high amplitudes.
 To get the next time point, one calculates a midpoint derivative iteratively
 at time to get the next time point at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{n+1/2}=t_{n}+\Delta t/2$
\end_inset

, to give an estimated midpoint field 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{a}}^{(i)}$

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 This is a second order Runge-Kutta method using an interaction picture.
 It is convergent to second order in time for non-stochastic equations,
 and for stochastic equations with additive noise, but otherwise it is first
 order.
 It often has higher errors than midpoint methods.
 It requires two IP transforms per step, but each is a full time-step long
 (
\begin_inset Formula $p.ipsteps=1$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the next time point, one calculates:

\mathbf{d}^{(1)} & =\Delta t\mathcal{P}\left(\Delta t\right)\cdot\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a}_{n},t_{n}\right]\\
\mathbf{d}^{(2)} & =\Delta t\mathcal{D}\left[\bar{\mathbf{a}}+\mathbf{d}^{(1)},t_{n+1}\right]\\
\mathbf{a}_{n+1} & =\bar{\mathbf{a}}+\left(\mathbf{d}^{(1)}+\mathbf{d}^{(2)}\right)/2.
\end{aligned}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\emph default
: fourth order Runge-Kutta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "algorithms:fourth-order-runge-kutta"

\end_inset

 This is a fourth order Runge-Kutta method using an interaction picture.
 It is convergent to fourth order in time for non-stochastic equations,
 but for stochastic equations it can be more slowly convergent than the
 midpoint method.
 It requires four half-length IP transforms per step (
\emph on
ipsteps
\emph default
 = 2).
 To get the next time point, one calculates four derivatives sequentially:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}\bar{\mathbf{a}} & =\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\cdot\left[\mathbf{a}_{n}\right]\\
\mathbf{d}^{(1)} & =\frac{\Delta t}{2}\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\cdot\mathcal{D}\left[\mathbf{a}_{n},t_{n}\right]\\
\mathbf{d}^{(2)} & =\frac{\Delta t}{2}\mathcal{D}\left[\bar{\mathbf{a}}+\mathbf{d}^{(1)},t_{n+1/2}\right]\\
\mathbf{d}^{(3)} & =\frac{\Delta t}{2}\mathcal{D}\left[\bar{\mathbf{a}}+\mathbf{d}^{(2)},t_{n+1/2}\right]\\
\mathbf{d}^{(4)} & =\frac{\Delta t}{2}\mathcal{D}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\left[\bar{\mathbf{a}}+2\mathbf{d}^{(3)},t_{n+1}\right]\right]\\
\mathbf{a}_{n+1} & =\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{2}\right)\cdot\left[\bar{\mathbf{a}}+\left(\mathbf{d}^{(1)}+2\left(\mathbf{d}^{(2)}+\mathbf{d}^{(3)}\right)\right)/3\right]+\mathbf{d}^{(4)}/3
\end{aligned}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This might seem the obvious choice, having the highest order.
 However, it can converge at a range of apparent rates, depending on the
 relative importance of stochastic and non-stochastic terms.
 Due to its use of differentiability, it may converge more slowly than the
 midpoint method with stochastic terms present.
 It is the default for ODE and PDE cases.

\begin_layout Section
Weighted library
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some types of stochastic equation, there is a weight associated with
 each trajectory, which is used to weight the probability of the trajectory
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This type of equation is sometimes found when dealing with quantum trajectories

 and feedback

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the results for mean values are weighted by a term 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(\Omega\left(t\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \mathbf{O}\right\rangle _{\Omega}=\frac{\sum_{n}\mathbf{O}\left(\mathbf{a}^{\left(n\right)}\right)\exp\left(\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\left(t\right)\right)}{\sum_{n}\exp\left(\Omega^{\left(n\right)}\left(t\right)\right)}.\label{eq:Weighted-averages}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reduces to the standard expression of Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\left(t\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 To simulate these equations automatically, the weight exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is integrated as the 
\emph on
last
\emph default
 field in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, which must have at least two components.
 A nonzero threshold weight, 
\begin_inset Formula $thresholdw$

 Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Before each plotted step in the calculation, a breeding calculation is
 carried out.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $p.steps(1)-1$
\end_inset

 of these in total.
 During breeding, any weight such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(\Omega^{(n)}\right)<thresholdw/\left\langle \exp\left(\Omega\right)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most probable trajectory is then duplicated to replace the low-weight
 trajectory.
 Both exponential weights are halved, so the total weight of the remaining
 trajectories is unchanged.
 If they are complex, weights such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(Re\left(\Omega^{(n)}\right)\right)<thresholdw/\left\langle \exp\left(Re\left(\Omega\right)\right)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are removed, and the real weight of the bred trajectory is reduced, which
 removes any low-weight trajectories that don't contribute.
 When used, the internal variable 
\emph on
p.breedw 
\emph default
is set to allow the fraction of trajectories that are bred per step to be
 monitored.
 For weighted SPDEs, the spatial weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(x_{j})$

 are summed over space points to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 The projected SDE then has the form of a Stratonovich SDE, where:

When numerically integrating these, it is also useful to have a normal projectio

\begin_layout Section
Forward-backward library
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xSPDE forward-backward library implements an iterative stochastic method
 which propagates an SDE or PSDE forward and backward in time.
 This is used to treat Q-function phase-space methods, which do not have
 a positive-definite diffusion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drummond2020Retrocausal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The iteration converges in simple cases, typically with no cross-coupling
 apart from boundary conditions.
 It uses the algorithm 
\emph on
MPfb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general FB equations have the following structure, written as an integral
 equation to make it clear what the relevant boundary conditions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{p}\left(t\right) & =\mathbf{p}\left(0,\mathbf{q}\left(0\right)\right)+\int_{0}^{t}\left\{ \mathbf{A}^{p}\left[\mathbf{a}\left(t'\right)\right]dt'+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{p}\left[\mathbf{a}\left(t'\right)\right]\cdot d\mathbf{w}^{p}(t')\right\} \nonumber \\
\mathbf{q}\left(t\right) & =\mathbf{q}\left(T,\mathbf{p}\left(T\right)\right)+\int_{t}^{T}\left\{ \mathbf{A}^{q}\left[\mathbf{a}\left(t'\right)\right]dt'+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{q}\left[\mathbf{a}\left(t'\right)\right]\cdot d\mathbf{w}^{q}(t')\right\} .
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\left[\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}\right]$
\end_inset

 includes forward components 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

 and backwards components 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

.
 These have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

initial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conditions in the past and the future, respectively, and can depend on
 random inputs, just as with ordinary stochastic equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The library includes the 
\emph on
xpathfb
\emph default
 function which replaces the 
\emph on
xpath
\emph default
 function, which is used automatically.
 However, the user must specify a modified step integrator, either 
\emph on
Eulerfb
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
MPfb
\emph default
.
 The 
\emph on
initial
\emph default
 and deriv routines require additional arguments, which are described in
 the table below, and are used during the iteration scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}=\left[\mathbf{w}^{p},\mathbf{w}^{q}\right]$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated real Gaussian noises: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle dw_{i}^{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)dw_{j}^{\beta}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}\delta_{\alpha\beta}dt.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is solved in differential form, where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{-}=T-t$
\end_inset

, as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{p}}{\partial t} & =\mathbf{A}^{p}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{p}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}^{p}(t)\,\nonumber \\
\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial t_{-}} & =\mathbf{A}^{q}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{q}\left[\mathbf{a}\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}^{q}(t)\,.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each equation is solved by iteration.
 The previous value of the counter-propagating field, ie 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{(n-1)}$
\end_inset

, is used to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{(n)}$
\end_inset

 in step 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, since the current value is not yet known.
 That is, the algorithm is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{p}^{(n)}}{\partial t} & =\mathbf{A}^{p}\left[\mathbf{p}^{(n)}\left(t\right),\mathbf{q}^{(n-1)}\left(t\right)\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{p}\left[\mathbf{p}^{(n)}\left(t\right),\mathbf{q}^{(n-1)}\left(t\right)\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}^{p}\left(t\right)\,\\
\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}^{(n)}}{\partial t_{-}} & =\mathbf{A}^{q}\left[\mathbf{p}^{(n-1)}\left(t_{-}\right),\mathbf{q}^{(n)}\left(t_{-}\right)\right]+\underline{\mathbf{B}}^{q}\left[\mathbf{p}^{(n-1)}\left(t_{-}\right),\mathbf{q}^{(n)}\left(t_{-}\right)\right]\cdot\mathbf{w}^{q}\left(t_{-}\right)\,,\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

Convergence is the responsibility of the user, and the algorithm has a fixed
 number of iterations.
 The starting point of the iteration is the path function 
\begin_inset Formula $fbfirst$
\end_inset

.
 The simulation requires the following additional inputs, including 
\begin_inset Formula $backfields$
\end_inset

, defining the backward components.

Discretization errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To check convergence, xSPDE repeats the calculations at least twice for
 checking step-sizes, and many times more in stochastic cases to estimate
 sampling errors.
 These checks can be turned on and off.
 
\emph on
If you think the checks make xSPDE slow, turn them off - but you won't get
 any error-estimates.

\emph default
 Whatever the application, you will find the error-estimates useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the errors are too large relative to the application, you should decrease
 the time-steps or increase the number of samples.
 Which is needed depends on the type of error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors caused by the finite time-domain step-size are checked automatically
 provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $checks=1$
\end_inset

 is specified, which is the default option.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $checks=0$
\end_inset

 is used, there is no time-domain error check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors due to a finite step-size are estimated by running a check simulations
 with half the initial step-size and the same random sequence, extrapolating
 to zero step-size if 
\begin_inset Formula $order>0$
\end_inset

 is specified, then returning an error bound as the difference of the two
 most accurate results.
 Any 2D output graphs plot error-bars if 
\begin_inset Formula $checks=1$
\end_inset

 was specified, provided they are large enough to plot.
 RMS output errors are also reported.
 Individual error bounds 
\begin_inset Formula $e\left(o\right)$
\end_inset

 are given in the output data, and the plots give 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{o}\pm e\left(o\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error-bars below a minimum relative size compared to the vertical range
 of the plot, specified by the graphics variable 
\begin_inset Formula $minbar$
\end_inset

, are not plotted.
 The default for this is 
\begin_inset Formula $minbar=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 All error bars are calculated individually for each type of data average.
 Minbar is a cell array that can can be set for each type of average or
 graph.
 If the cell argument is omitted, it applies globally.
 Error estimates are also given for functional transforms of averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the errors are too large, one can either increase the 
\emph on
points
\emph default
, which gives more plotted points and lower errors, or increase the 
\emph on
steps, 
\emph default
which reduces the step size without changing the data resolution.
 The default algorithm and extrapolation order can also be changed.
 Error bars on graphs can be removed by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $checks=0$
\end_inset

 or increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $minbar$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discretization errors caused by the finite spatial lattice are not currently
 checked in the xSIM code.
 They must be checked by comparing results with different transverse lattice
 ranges and step-size.
 Similarly, errors from probability binning are not checked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discretization error outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In xSPDE, the discretization or step-size error due to finite time-step
 sizes is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

step
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 error.
 For checking step errors, xSPDE allows the user to specify 
\begin_inset Formula $checks=1$
\end_inset

, which is the default option.
 This gives one integration at the specified step-size, and one at half
 the specified step-size.
 The data is plotted using the more accurate fine step-size results, but
 with the coarse time lattice in order to calculate the estimated discretization
 errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RMS value of the step error for each computed function, normalized by
 the maximum modulus of the observable, is printed out after each xSPDE
 simulation.
 If the expected comparison value is zero, the absolute value is given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both fine and coarse time-step results employ identical underlying random
 noise processes, from the same initial random seed.
 To compensate for the grid size, the coarse time-step uses a sum of two
 successive fine noise increments.
 This has the advantage that any differences are only from the effects of
 the time-step on the integration accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If different noises were used, part of the measured error-bar would be from
 sampling errors.
 Where there is 2D graphical output, the error bars give the step error,
 if you set 
\begin_inset Formula $p.checks=1$
\end_inset

.
 The standard error-bar, with no extrapolation, has a half-size equal to
 the difference of the two most accurate results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If computed, the discretization error is included in the graphical data
 outputs for all observables.
 It is accessed by setting the last index for the output data equal 2.
 The raw discretization error is generally a very cautious estimate, and
 may overestimate the errors.
 This estimate can be improved using extrapolation, explained next.

xSPDE uses extrapolation to improve convergence, which requires an input

.
 If this is non-zero, and 
\emph on

\emph default
 are set to 1 to allow successive integration with two different step-sizes,
 the output of all data graphed will be extrapolated by assuming the method
 has the specified order.
 To remove extrapolation and obtain a more conservative mean and error-bar

Extrapolation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extrapolation is valuable for improving the accuracy of a differential equation
 solver.
 It is valid for small time-steps.
 Suppose an algorithm has a correct solution 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}$
\end_inset

, but returns a numerical result 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with an error order 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 For small step-size, integration results 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(dt\right)$
\end_inset

 with step-size 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 have an error of order 
\begin_inset Formula $dt^{n}$
\end_inset

, that is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}R\left(dt\right)=R_{0}+e\left(R\right)=R_{0}+k.dt^{n}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, from two results at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $dt,$
\end_inset

 differing by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, one would obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}R_{1} & =R\left(dt\right)=R_{0}+k.dt^{n}\\
R_{2} & =R\left(2dt\right)=R_{0}+2^{n}k.dt^{n}.
\end{aligned}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The true result, extrapolated to the small-step size limit, is obtained
 by giving more weight to the fine step-size result, while 
\emph on
subtracting
\emph default
 from this a correction due to the coarse step-size calculation, to cancel
 the leading error term: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}R_{0}=\frac{\left[R_{1}-R_{2}2^{-n}\right]}{\left[1-2^{-n}\right]}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus, if we define a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\epsilon\left(n\right)=\frac{1}{\left[2^{n}-1\right]}=\left(1,\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{7}\ldots\right),\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

the true results are obtained from extrapolation to zero step-size as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}R_{0}=\left(1+\epsilon\right)R_{1}-\epsilon R_{2}.\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The built-in algorithms have an order as ordinary differential equation
 integrators of 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4 respectively and will converge to this
 order at small step-sizes.
 Weak first order convergence is always obtainable for these single noise-step
 SDE methods

 Second order convergence is obtained in some cases with midpoint, RK2 and

Higher order convergence for the raw data is not guaranteed for the built-in

\begin_layout Subsection
Extrapolated error-bars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If extrapolation is used, the error bar half-size is the difference of the
 best raw estimate and the extrapolation.
 Extrapolated results are usually inside those given by the error-bars,
 however, note that: 
\end_layout

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, xSPDE assumes a default order of 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 = 1 for all SDE and SPDE cases.
 This gives an extrapolated weak order of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 for stochastic cases.
 One can set 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 = 0 to remove the default, or use a higher order if preferred, although,
 as explained above, it requires some caution.
 For an ODE or PDE the default order is the usual deterministic order.
 For the default RK4 deterministic method, the default is 
\emph on

\emph default
 = 4.
 All orders are improved by one with extrapolation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High-order convergence

 extrapolation can also be obtained, either in special cases using the xSPDE

 The xSPDE libraries can be readily extended by the user to include these,

\begin_layout Section
Statistical errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sampling error estimation in xSIM uses three different techniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
xSIM uses sub-ensemble averaging, requiring high-level ensembles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For probability estimates, a Poissonian sampling error is used, based on
 counts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If there is a comparison probability, this is used for sampling error estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedure leads to reliable sampling error estimates, and makes efficient
 use of the vector instruction sets used by Matlab.
 Ensembles are specified in three levels.
 The first, 
\emph on
ensembles(1)
\emph default
, is called the number of samples for brevity.
 All computed quantities returned by the 
\series bold
\emph on
observe
\series default
\emph default
 functions are first averaged over the samples, which are calculated efficiently
 using a parallel vector of trajectories.
 By the central limit theorem, these low-level sample averages are distributed
 as a normal distribution at large sample number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, the sample averages are averaged again over the two higher level ensembles
, if specified.
 This time, the variance is accumulated.
 The variance of these distributions is used to estimate a standard deviation
 in the mean, since each computed quantity is now a normally distributed
 result.
 This method is applied to all the
\emph on
 
\emph default
observables.
 The two lines generated represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{o}\pm\sigma\left(o\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is the observe function output, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation in the mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\emph on
ensembles(2)
\emph default
 specifies ensembles computed in series.
 The highest level ensemble, 
\emph on
ensembles(3), 
\emph default
is used for parallel simulations.
 This is faster for a multiple core CPU or when the codes are run in a supercomp
uting environment, which requires the Matlab parallel toolbox.
 Either type of high-level ensemble, or both together, can be used to calculate
 sampling errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(2)>1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(3)>1$
\end_inset

, which allows xSPDE to calculate sampling errors, it will plot upper and
 lower limits of one standard deviation.
 If the sampling errors are too large, try increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(1)$
\end_inset


\emph on
, 
\emph default
which increases the trajectories in a single thread.
 An alternative is to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(2)$
\end_inset

, which is slower, but is only limited by the compute time, or else to increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(3)$
\end_inset

, which gives higher level parallelization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each is limited in different ways: the first by memory, the second by time,
 the third by the number of cores.
 Sampling error control helps ensures accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sampling error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantitative sampling error estimation in xSPDE uses sub-ensemble averaging.
 Ensembles are specified in three levels, using vector, serial and parallel
 methods, respectively.
 The vector ensemble length, 
\shape italic
p.ensembles(1)
\shape default
, is called the number of samples for brevity.
 All quantities returned by the observe functions are averaged over the
 samples, which are calculated efficiently using a vector of trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the central limit theorem, the sample averages are distributed as a normal
 distribution at large sample number.
 Next, the sample averages are averaged over the two higher level ensembles,
 if specified.
 The variance of this data is used to estimate a standard deviation in the
 mean, since each is normally distributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next level, 
\emph on
p.ensembles(2)
\emph default
, is for serial calculations of ensembles.
 The highest level ensemble, 
\emph on
p.ensembles(3)
\emph default
, is used for parallel simulations.
 This requires the Matlab parallel toolbox.
 Either type of high-level ensemble, or both together, can be used to calculate
 sampling errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that one standard deviation is not a strong bound; errors are expected
 to exceed this value in 
\begin_inset Formula $32\%$
\end_inset

 of observed measurements.
 Another point to remember is that stochastic errors are often correlated,
 so that a group of points may all have similar errors due to statistical
 sampling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical error due to finite samples of trajectories is called the
 sampling error.
 The RMS value of the relative sampling error for each computed function,
 normalized by the maximum modulus of the observable, is printed out after
 each xSPDE simulation.
 If the expected comparison value is zero, the absolute value is given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Averages over stochastic ensembles are the specialty of xSPDE, which requires
 specification of the ensemble size.
 A hierarchy of ensemble specifications in three levels allows maximum resource
 utilization, so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.ensembles=[ensembles(1),ensembles(2),ensembles(3)]\,.
\]

\end_inset

The local ensemble, 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

, gives within-thread parallelism, allowing vector instruction use for single-co
re efficiency.
 The serial ensemble, 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

, gives the number of independent sub-ensembles of trajectories calculated
 serially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parallel ensemble, 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

, gives multi-core parallelism, and requires the Matlab parallel toolbox.
 This improves speed when there are multiple cores.
 One should optimally put 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

 equal to the available number of CPU cores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
total 
\emph default
number of stochastic trajectories or samples is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ensembles(1)\times ensembles(2)\times ensembles(3)\,.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Either 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(2)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(3)$
\end_inset

 are required if sampling error-bars are to be calculated, owing to the
 sub-ensemble averaging method used in xSPDE to calculate sampling errors
 accurately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two lines are graphed for an upper and lower standard deviation departure
 from the mean.
 This is only plotted if the total number of serial or parallel ensembles
 is greater than one, preferably at least 10–20 to give reliable estimates.
 The sampling error is reasonably accurate, but may underestimate errors
 for observe function results that have highly non-Gaussian trajectory distribut
ions, especially with asymmetries.
 These estimates are available for all observables in any dimension.
 The two lines generated in the graphs represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{o}\pm\sigma$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is the mean output, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the computed standard deviation in the mean.

 This generates a vector of analytic solutions or experimental data-points

\begin_layout Section
Chi-squared estimates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chi-squared error estimates are reported in cases that have statistical
 sampling errors and comparison functions.
 These allow estimates of goodness of fit for probabilities.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{p}$
\end_inset

 independent points graphed or measured, if 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an observable with measured mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{O}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and statistical fluctuations 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta O_{i},$
\end_inset

 one has that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}/N_{p}=\frac{1}{N_{p}}\sum_{i}\frac{\left\langle \left[\left(\bar{O}_{i}+\Delta O_{i}\right)-O_{i}^{a}\right]^{2}\right\rangle }{\sigma_{i}^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is an estimated variance.
 Provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \Delta O_{i}^{2}\right\rangle =\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{O}_{i}=O_{i}^{a}$
\end_inset

, one should obtain the expected result of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}/N_{p}\approx1$
\end_inset

.
 The exact distribution is known in special cases, but this requires that
 all data is independent and has a Gaussian distribution, which is not the
 case for stochastic trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the variety of error-sources, and the lack of independence from
 point to point, these error sums are not identical to Pearson's original
 definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

, and therefore should be used with caution.
 Nevertheless, the definition provides a way of evaluating goodness of fit
 that is useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by including 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 known error sources, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{i}^{2}=\sum_{n=1}^{4}\left(\sigma_{i}^{(n)}\right)^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If sub-ensemble measures are used, the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 includes sampling errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If checks are included, the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 includes discretization errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If comparisons have systematic errors, e.g.
 from experimental data, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If comparisons have known statistical errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of sampled probabilities where there is a comparison probability,
 the estimated statistical variance in the data is obtained following Pearson's
 original method.
 That is, from 
\emph on
estimated counts given the comparison probability
\emph default
, rather than a computed variance.
 This allows the use of standard 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Probability comparisons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons of trajectory probabilities and analytic probabilities do not
 always result in perfect agreement.
 This is because the limitations of memory and simulation time mean that
 trajectories have to be binned, which leads to an additional discretization
 error.
 Note that xSPDE approximates the comparison analytic probability of a bin
 by the central bin value of the probability, which is the simplest procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain this, comparisons of probabilities ought to use the average probabili
ty density over the bin, which is different from the central value.
 Suppose one has a comparison distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{a}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Using Simpson's rule, the average analytic probability density integrated
 over a bin size 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 is approximately: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p_{o}^{a} & =\frac{1}{\Delta x}\int_{x_{0}-\Delta x/2}^{x_{0}+\Delta x/2}p^{a}(x)dx\\
 & \approx\frac{1}{6}\left[4p^{a}(x_{0})+p^{a}\left(x_{0}+\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)+p^{a}\left(x_{0}-\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right).\right]\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is equivalent to a cubic polynomial fit.
 It can be used to improve the analytic binning comparisons.
 It is especially important for multi-dimensional comparisons.
 It results in 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

 distinct terms for two dimensions.
 This correction must be inserted manually in the comparison functions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because chi-squared probability tests are sensitive, it helps to understand
 how they scale with bin-size.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

 total samples, the estimated probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 in a bin with probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 and sampled counts of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}=N_{i}/N_{s}=p_{i}A$
\end_inset

 for a bin 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 with area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, where: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{i}=\frac{1}{A}\int_{b_{i}}p\left(\mathbf{a}\right)dA
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Poissonian variance of the counts in the bin is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \Delta N_{i}\right\rangle =\left\langle N_{i}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The expected probability variance is therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta P^{2}\right\rangle =\left\langle \Delta N_{i}^{2}/N_{s}^{2}\right\rangle =\left\langle N_{i}\right\rangle /N_{s}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{i}\right\rangle =N_{i}^{a}$
\end_inset

, the analytic or expected count number.
 The expected probability density variance at a point is therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta p_{i}^{2}\right\rangle =\left\langle \Delta N_{i}^{2}/A^{2}N_{s}^{2}\right\rangle =N_{i}^{a}/A^{2}N_{s}^{2}=p_{i}^{a}/AN_{s}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{a}$
\end_inset

 is the analytic or comparison probability density, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \Delta p_{i}^{2}\right\rangle ^{a}=p_{i}^{a}/AN_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the expected analytic variance.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 variable, that follows the Pearson 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution, is defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}/N_{p}=\frac{1}{N_{p}}\sum_{i}\frac{\left\langle \left[p_{i}-p_{i}^{a}\right]^{2}\right\rangle }{\left\langle \Delta p_{i}^{2}\right\rangle }
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{a}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by integrating over the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th probability bin.
 It can be estimated by using the central value, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{a}\approx p\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, although cubic interpolation is more precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This could lead to a fixed error in the analytic probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{a}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{a}\rightarrow p_{i}^{a}+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

, possibly localized to some fraction of bins 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 which may change with the bin size.
 Suppose, for simplicity, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is due to an integration error in integrating the exact distribution or
 any other error in the 'exact' distribution, and it does not change with
 changes to the bin area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

, if the generated samples have negligible step-size errors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}/N_{p}=\frac{1}{N_{p}}\sum_{i}\frac{\left\langle \left[\left(p_{i}^{a}+\Delta p_{i}\right)-p_{i}^{a}-\epsilon_{i}\right]^{2}\right\rangle }{\left\langle \Delta p_{i}^{2}\right\rangle }
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For simplicity, if we consider the large sample limit with uniform probabilities
, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\chi^{2}/N_{p} & =1+\frac{f\epsilon^{2}}{\left\langle \Delta p^{2}\right\rangle }=1+\frac{f\epsilon^{2}AN_{s}}{p^{a}}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasing the bin area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 will increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}/N_{p}$
\end_inset

 above its usual value of 
\emph on
1
\emph default
 by an amount proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This is simply because smaller bins have less intrinsic accuracy, due to
 a larger sampling error.
 As a result, it is often preferable to use more accurate probability estimates
 with larger bins having more counts, since these are much more sensitive
 to effects like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, simulated and comparison graphs may appear identical visually, but
 even if they have small errors they may still be very significant.
 Such comparison binning errors can be reduced by using cubic spline interpolati
ons, as explained above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Error outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six types of data outputs: data, step errors, sampling errors,
 comparisons and any comparison systematic and/or random errors.
 Summaries of this will appear in the printed outputs if available.
 Step errors and sampling errors, as well as comparison data are stored
 in all the output data arrays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Numerical error outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last data index 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is used to obtain errors and comparisons in data outputs.
 To obtain comparison data, a comparison function is defined for each output
 function.
 This can include, for example, experimental data, experimental errors or
 exact analytic comparisons where they are available.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Comparison systematic errors give additional error bars 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Comparison statistical errors can be included as parallel lines 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because multiple errors can generate very complex graphs, there is additional
 control of error bar generation, explained in the xGRAPH reference section.
 One can also obtain difference graphs with comparisons, which allow errors
 to be examined more closely, and error bars can be combined in different
 ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphics data is only available for two-dimensional graphs, and is subject
 to selection using the 
\emph on
axes 
\emph default
inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Printed error outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Printed error summaries are generated in each xSIM run, in addition to the
 data outputs.
 These are normalized, root mean square (RMS) errors.
 Normalization is carried out using the modulus of the largest data value.
 If the comparison results are all zero for a function, there is no normalizatio
n carried out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After computing RMS values over each graph function, a second RMS average
 is taken over all totals, weighting each total equally, and including all
 functions and sequence datasets where there are nonzero errors reported.
 Data with no errors are not included in the totals for each category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a final RMS average taken over the step, sampling and comparison
 totals.
 This again ignores categories with no errors.
 The purpose is to allow a rapid comparison to ensure that there are no
 higher than expected errors, which might require a new simulation with
 more steps or increased trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Printed errors are summarized in three main categories 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Discretization or step errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sampling errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Comparison errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison data may not be available over an entire lattice.
 If this is the case, the 
\emph on
axes 
\emph default
point selections can be used to restrict the relevant datas points used
 for these comparisons.
 This also applies to the goodness of fit and error-vector outputs, since
 they make use of comparison data where it is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goodness of fit (
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistics are obtained by normalizing the comparison squared differences
 by the sum of squares of all the data and comparison errors at that point.
 These are summed over every data point with relevant data, and the number
 of relevant data points, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, is stored.
 The ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}/k$
\end_inset

 should be order 1 for statistical errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are summarized for each functional data output type, as well as giving
 rise to an error total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error vector output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When used as a function call in batch mode, the first type of data returned
 by xSIM is a six-component error vector.
 This can be used for summarizing error data in a batch job, to determine
 if a specified error-threshold is reached, to allow an iterative increase
 in the number of time-steps or trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error-vector components are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Total error overall, including step, discretization and comparisons 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Error summaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six types of data outputs: data, errors, comparisons and comparison
 errors.
 Summaries will appear in the printed outputs, depending on the verbosity
 setting.
 Step errors and sampling errors, as well as comparison data are stored
 in output data arrays.
 These are also available graphically in two-dimensional graphs.

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations carried out by xSPDE are performed by xSIM, then graphed by
 xGRAPH.
 Input parameters come from an 
\series bold
input
\series default
 sequence of parameter structures, while output is saved in a 
\series bold
data
\series default
 array, and optionally in data files.
 During the simulation, global averages are calculated for time-step and
 sampling errors, togther with comparisons.
 When completed, timing and errors are printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Output data storage and batch jobs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An xSPDE session can either run simulations interactively, described in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Simulating-an-SDE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, or else using a function file called a project file.
 In either case, the Matlab path must include the xSPDE folder.
 For generating graphs automatically, the script input or project function
 should end with the combined function 
\series bold
xspde
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, it can be useful to divide xSPDE into its simulation function,
 xSIM, and its graphics function, xGRAPH, to allow graphs to be made at
 a later time from the simulation.
 In this case the function
\series bold
 
\begin_inset Formula $xsim$
\end_inset


\series default
 runs the simulation, and 
\begin_inset Formula $xgraph$
\end_inset

 makes the graphs.
 The two-stage option is better for running batch jobs which you can graph
 at a later time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Batch input template
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a data file, you must enter the filename when running the simulation,
 using the 
\begin_inset Formula $p.file=filename$
\end_inset

 input.
 A typical xSPDE project function of this type, where all the data is stored
 is as follows:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alternatively, 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
You can use either Matlab (.mat) or standard HDF5 (.h5) file-types for data

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sequence 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 defines a sequence of individual simulations, with parameters that specify
 the simulation functions and give the equations and observables.
 If there is only one simulation, just one data structure is needed, without
 a cell array.
 In addition, xSPDE can generates graphs with its own graphics program,
 xGRAPH.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For convergence checking, a useful alternative to xspde which repeats the

 times while halving the time-step each time, and reports the resulting
 errors for averaged observables, is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters that xSIM uses are divided into applications for ease of
 use.
 Almost all parameters have default values.
 The SDE parameters are common to all applications, but the default values
 may be changed in more specialized cases.
 Defaults are defined through 
\emph on
preference
\emph default
 functions that are included in each application folder.
 Parameters are shared between the applications where this is meaningful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current application folders are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SDE Stochastic differential equation data and methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SPDE Partial differential equation extensions and grids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
PROJECTIONS This is the projective library, used to solve projected SDE/SPDEs

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
PHASE Quantum phase-space and scalable network applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FBE Iterative forward-backward stochastic equation solvers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All applications use a common definition of cell arrays of integration variables
, and cell arrays of output averages.
 In all cases, a single variable, vector or array can be used instead of
 a multicomponent cell array.
 All data outputs are xGRAPH compatible, except for 
\emph on
raw 
\emph default
trajectory outputs that need to be further processed if graphs are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User functions and parameters table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xSIM input objects include parameters and functions, with an extensible
 architecture.
 All xSIM functions are modular and replaceable.
 This is as easy as just defining a new function handle to replace the default
 value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two types of functions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
User
\emph default
 functions define the equations, and have default values.
 The defaults are usually obtained by adding 'x' in front of the name.
 In the special case of 
\emph on
method
\emph default
, the default depends on the problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Helper
\emph default
 functions usually start with 
\emph on
'x'
\emph default
.
 In some cases these are defaults for user functions.
 In all cases they have well-defined roles, like the reserved functions
 in C, Python, Matlab or Julia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All arguments in square brackets are optional, but may be needed only in
 specific cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The last argument, 
\emph on
p,
\emph default
 is the parameter structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to define your own integration function, include in the xSPDE/xSIM
 input the line: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Box Doublebox
position "t"
hor_pos "l"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter

Simulation parameters are stored in a parameter structure which is passed
 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $xsim$
\end_inset

 program.
 Constants can be included, but must not be reserved names.
 Names starting with a capital letter like 'A...' - except the reserved '
\emph on

\emph default
' for derivatives - are always available.
 Globals are incompatible with the Matlab parallel toolbox.
 Graphics data is stored for the graphics program to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard inputs have default values, which are user-modifiable through the
\emph on
 xpreferences
\emph default
 function.
 Defaults can be checked by including the input 
\begin_inset Formula $verbose=2$
\end_inset


\emph on
.

\emph default
 All the inputs are part of a structure passed to xSPDE.
 If a cell array of multiple structures are input, these are executed in
 sequence, with the output of the first simulation passed to the second,
 then the third, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Library functions inputs do not have defaults, as these are subject to change.

Extensible functions

\begin_layout Standard
Extensible functions define the numerical methods used.
 They use a similar pattern of 
\emph on
(fields..,noises.., parameters)
\emph default
.
 However, for efficiency, these pass and return cell arrays where needed.
 The returned variable is always one field.
 Where several fields are needed, they are obtained from a cell array of
 functions.
 The cell array indices listed below can be omitted if there is only one
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These all have defaults, and don't have to be given in detail if the default
 available is used.
 Any compatible user functions can be employed instead.
 However, these have system default values, which don't usually have to
 be changed unless required.

 They can all normalise quantum wavefunctions and density matrices if needed,
 and treat vectors, arrays and cells.
 The MP and RK methods are intended for Stratonovich equations.The '*' methods
 are for Ito equations, while '**' methods are for time-reversed Ito equations.

The wave-functions that are integrated are stored in a packed, one-dimensional
 form with sparse operators, and in a multidimensional array with functional
 operators.
 The use of sparse vs functional operators is a trade-off, with sparse operators
 usually giving faster results, but requiring greater overall memory storage.

Knowing the details of array indexing inside xSPDE isn't usually necessary.
 Yet it becomes important if you want to write your own functions to extend
 xSPDE, interface xSPDE with other functions, or read and write xSPDE data
 files with external programs.
 It also helps to understand how the program works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
xGRAPH overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics function provided is a general purpose multidimensional batch
 graphics code, xGRAPH, which is automatically called by xSPDE when xSIM
 is finished.
 The results are graphed and output if required.
 Alternatively, xGRAPH can be replaced by another graphics code, or it can
 be used to process the data generated by the xSIM function at a later time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
xgraph
\emph default
 function call syntax is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\emph on
xgraph (data [,input])
\series default
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This takes simulation 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 cell arrays, then plots graphs.
 The 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 should have as many cells as there are 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 cells, for sequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\emph on
data = 'filename.h5'
\emph default
 or
\emph on
 'filename.mat'
\emph default
, the specified file is read both for 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
data
\emph default
.
 Here 
\emph on
.h5
\emph default
 indicates an HDF5 file, and 
\emph on
.mat
\emph default
 indicates a Matlab file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 input is a filename, parameters in the file can be replaced by new 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 parameters that are specified.
 Any stored 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 in the file is then overwritten when graphs are generated.
 This allows graphs of data to be modified retrospectively, if the simulation
 takes too long to be run again in a reasonable timeframe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter and data structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a batch graphics function, intended to process quantities of graphics
 data, input as a cell array of multi-dimensional data.
 Theoretical and/or experimental data is passed to the graphics program,
 including the complete 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 cell array and a cell array of graphics parameters for plotting each graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain xGRAPH in full detail, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data to be graphed are recorded sequentially in a cell array, with 
\emph on
data={d1,d2,...}
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Graphics parameters including defaults are given in the 
\emph on

\emph default
 cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This describes a sequence of graph parameters, so that 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a one member sequence, a dataset and parameter structure can be used
 on its own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each dataset and parameter structure describes a set of graphs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data input to 
\emph on
xGRAPH 
\emph default
can either come from a file, or from data generated directly with 
\emph on
xSIM
\emph default
.
 The main graphics data is a nested cell array.
 It contains several numerical graphics arrays.
 Each defines one independent set of averaged data, the observed data averages,
 stored in a cell array indexed as 
\begin_inset Formula $data\{s\}\{n\}(\ell,\mathbf{j},c)$
\end_inset

.
 To graph these also requires a corresponding cell array of structures of
 graphics parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output is unlimited, apart from memory limits.
 The program also generates error comparisons and chi-squared values if
 required.
 The data structure for input is as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The input 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 is a cell array of 
\emph on
datasets, 
\emph default
which can be collapsed to a single dataset 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The
\emph on
 parameters
\emph default
 are also a cell array of parameter structures, which can be collapsed to
 one structure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\emph on
dataset 
\emph default
is a cell array of multidimensional 
\emph on
graphs
\emph default
, each with arbitrary dimensionality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first or 
\emph on
line
\emph default
 index of each graph array allows multiple lines, with different line-styles
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The last or 
\emph on
check
\emph default
 index of each graph array is optionally used for error and comparison fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each 
\emph on
graph
\emph default
 array can generate multiple graphic plots, as defined by the parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphical data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following table show how xSPDE output data is stored, which helps customize
 and extend the code.
 There are several different types of arrays used.
 The observed averages are generated internally from the observe functions,
 
\emph on
p.observe
\emph default
.
 These are then modified by user functions 
\emph on
p.function
\emph default
, and exported as graphics data.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple uses for the last index, 
\emph on
c
\emph default
.
 It can be omitted if needed.
 If present, it stores data for errors and comparisons.
 This is indicated by the input parameter field 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $p.errors>0$
\end_inset


\emph default
, which is the index of the largest error field.
 If there are no parameters, or 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=0,$
\end_inset

 there is no error or comparison index.
 The standard value that xSIM outputs is 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=3.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the check index present, the index values are defined as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$
\end_inset

 for the average of the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
-th output function 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\begin_inset Formula $c=2$
\end_inset

 for the time-step error, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\begin_inset Formula $c=3$
\end_inset

 for the sampling error.
 
\end_layout

 for (optional) systematic comparison errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\begin_inset Formula $c=6$
\end_inset

 for (optional) statistical comparison errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If xGRAPH is used with data from an other source, with no simulation error
 fields, but with comparisons, then one simply puts 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=1$
\end_inset

, or if there is just one input error field 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparisons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every type of observation in xSIM, the observe function can be accompanied
 by a comparison function, 
\emph on
compare(p)
\emph default
.
 This generates a vector of analytic solutions or experimental data which
 is compared to the stochastic results.
 Results are plotted as additional lines on the two-dimensional graphical
 outputs, and comparison differences can be graphed in any dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons are possible for either moments or probabilities, and can be
 input in any number of dimensions.
 When there are error estimates, a chi-squared test is carried out to determine
 if the difference is within the expected step-size and sampling error bars.
 If the comparison has errors, for example from experimental data, the chi-squar
ed test will include the experimental errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison data can be added to the graphics files from any source.
 It must match the corresponding space-time lattice or probability bins
 that are in the graphed data.
 Note that the 
\emph on
compare 
\emph default
functions are specified during the simulation.
 The graphics code does not generate comparison data, as it is dedicated
 to graphics, not to generating data.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete cell array of the simulation data is passed to the 
\emph on
xGRAPH
\emph default
 program, along with graphics parameters for each observable, to create
 an extended graphics data structure.
 Graphics parameters have default values which are user-modifiable by editing
 the
\emph on
 xgpreferences
\emph default
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some input parameters are global parameters for all graphs.
 However, most 
\emph on
xGRAPH
\emph default
 parameters are cell arrays indexed by graph index.
 These graphics parameters are individually set for each output that is
 plotted, using the cell index 
\begin_inset Formula $\{n\}$
\end_inset

 in a curly bracket.
 If present they replace the global parameters like labels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a graph index is omitted, and the parameter is not a nested array, the
 program will use the same value for all graphs.
 The 
\emph on
axes
\emph default
, 
\emph on
glabels, legends, lines, logs, 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 xfunctions
\emph default
 of each graph are nested cell arrays, as there can be any number of lines
 and axis dimensions.
 In the case of the 
\emph on
logs
\emph default
 switch, the observable axis is treated as an extra dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted result can be an arbitrary function of the generated average
 data, by using the optional input
\emph on
 gfunction.
 
\emph default
If this is omitted, the
\emph on
 
\emph default
generated average data that is input is plotted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons are plotted if present in the input data indexed by the last

\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

The data is stored in a cell array 
\begin_inset Formula $data$
\end_inset

 with structure: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
data\{s\}\{n\}(\ell,\mathbf{j},c)
\]

\end_inset

Each member of the outer cell array 
\emph on
data{s}
\emph default
 defines a number of related sets of graphical data, all described by common
 parameters 
\emph on
input{s}
\emph default
.
 Comparisons and errors are plotted if there are errors and comparison data
 in the input, indexed by 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 This generates comparison plots, as well as error totals and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

- squared error estimate when there are statistical variances available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An individual member of 
\emph on

 is a multidimensional array, called a 
\emph on

\emph default
 in the xSPDE User's guide.
 For each

, multiple different plots with different dimensionality can be obtained
 from the dataset 
\emph on

, either through projections and slices or by generating additional data
 defined with graphics functions.
 Either or both alternatives are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that:

\begin_layout Itemize
If a sequence has one member, the outer cell array can be omitted.

\begin_layout Itemize
In this simplified case, if there is only one

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics data for a single dataset is held in a multidimensional real
 array, where: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is the index for lines in the graph.
 Even for one line, the first dimension is retained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}=j_{1},\ldots j_{d}$

 is the array index in each dimension, where

\begin_inset Formula $j_{d}=1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

If 
\begin_inset Formula $c>p.errors$
\end_inset

, the extra fields are comparison inputs, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors$
\end_inset

 is the largest data index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the optional comparison fields are used, an input parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $errors$
\end_inset

 is required to indicate the maximum error index, to distinguish data from
 comparisons.
 Parameter structures from xSIM have 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=3$
\end_inset

 set to allow for both sampling errors and discretization errors.
 If this is omitted, the default is 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=0$
\end_inset

, which implies that there is no error or comparison data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $errors>0$
\end_inset

, the last index can have larger values with 
\begin_inset Formula $c>errors$
\end_inset

, for comparisons.
 The special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=1$
\end_inset

 is used if the data has no error bars, but there are comparisons in the
 data.
 Larger indices are used to index the comparison data, which can also have
 two types of errors.
 The largest usable last index is 
\begin_inset Formula $errors+3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to directly plot the 
\emph on
raw 
\emph default
data using xGRAPH.
 One can even combine the raw data with a graphics parameter input.
 But since the raw data has no error estimates - it is raw data - one must
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=0$
\end_inset

, since the xsim output parameters have a normal setting of 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=3$
\end_inset

.
 This will give a single trajectory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the raw data from a simulation typically includes many trajectories
 if
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(1)>0$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 One must select particular trajectory datasets from the raw cell array,
 to plot just one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Input parameters and defaults
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sequence of graph parameters is obtained from inputs in a cell array,
 as 
\emph on
input = {in1, in2, ...}
\emph default
.
 The input parameters of each simulation in the sequence are specified in
 a Matlab structure.
 The inputs are numbers, vectors, strings, functions and cell arrays.
 All metadata has preferred values, so only changes from the preferences
 need to be input.
 The resulting data is stored internally as a sequence of structures in
 a cell array, to describe the simulation sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics parameters are also stored in the cell array 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 as a sequence of structures 
\emph on
p.

\emph default
 This only need to be input when the graphs are generated and can be changed
 at a later time to alter the graphics output.
 A sequence of simulations is graphed from 
\emph on
input
\emph default
 specifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is one simulation, just one structure can be input, without the
 sequence braces.
 The standard way to input each parameter value is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.label=parameter
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard way to input a function handle is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.label=@function
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inputs are scalar or vector parameters or function handles.
 Quantities relating to graphed averages are cell arrays, indexed by the
 graph number.
 The available inputs, with their default values in brackets, are given
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation metadata, including default values that were used in a particular
 simulation, can be included in the input data files.
 This is done in both the 
\emph on
.mat
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
.h5
\emph default
 output files generated by xSIM, so the entire graphics input can be reconstruct
ed or changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parameters can be numbers, vectors, strings or cell arrays.
 Conventions that are used are that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All input parameters have default values 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vector inputs of numbers are enclosed in square brackets, 
\emph on
[...]
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cell arrays of strings, functions or vectors are enclosed in curly brackets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vector or cell array inputs with only one member don’t require brackets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Incomplete parameter inputs are completed with the last used default value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Function definitions can be handles pointing elsewhere, or defined inline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any inputs are omitted, there are default values which are set by the
 internal function
\emph on
 xgpreferences
\emph default
.
 The defaults can be changed by editing 
\emph on
xgpreferences
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following descriptions, 
\emph on
graphs
\emph default
 is the total number of graphed variables of all types.
 The space coordinate, image, image-type and transverse data can be omitted
 if there is no spatial lattice, that is, if the dimension variable is set
 to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For uniformity, the graphics parameters that reference an individual data
 object are cell arrays.
 These are indexed over the graph number using braces 
\emph on
{}
\emph default
.
 If a different type of input is used, like a scalar or matrix, xSPDE will
 attempt to convert the type to a cell array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Axis labels are cell arrays, indexed over dimension.
 The graph number used to index these cell arrays refers to the data object.
 In each case there can be multiple generated plots, depending on the graphics
 input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cascaded plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xGRAPH function generates a default range of graphs, but this can be
 modified to suit the user.
 In the simplest case of one dimension, one graph dataset will generate
 a single plot.
 For higher dimensions, a cascade of plots is generated to allow visualization,
 starting from 3D movies, then 3D static plots and finally 2D slices.
 These can also be user modified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for all probabilities, the plot dimension is increased by the
 bin range dimensionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Plot dimensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
pdimension
\emph default
 input sets the maximum plotted dimensions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $pdimension\{1\}=1$
\end_inset

 means that only plots vs 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 are output for the first function plotted.
 Default values are used for the non-plotted dimensions, unless there are
 axes specified, as indicated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphs cascade down from higher to lower dimensions, generating different
 types of graphs.
 Each type of graph is generated once for each function index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Plot axes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics axes that are used for plotting and the points plotted are
 defined using the optional 
\emph on
axes
\series bold
 
\series default
\emph default
input parameters, where 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{n\}$
\end_inset

 indicates the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
-th specified graph or set of generated graph data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are no 
\emph on
axes
\series bold
 
\series default
\emph default
inputs, or the 
\emph on
axes
\emph default
 inputs are zero - for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0,0,0\}$
\end_inset

 - only the lowest dimensions are plotted, up to 
\emph on
3
\emph default
.
 If either the data or 
\emph on
axes
\series bold
 
\series default
\emph default
inputs project one point in a given dimension, - for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0,31,-1,0\}$
\end_inset

, this dimension is suppressed in the plots, which reduces the effective
 dimension of the data - in this case to two dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 1, plot all the first dimensional points; higher dimensions
 get defaults.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{2\}=\{-2,0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 2, plot the maximum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 (the default) and all higher-dimensional x-points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{3\}=\{1:4:51,32,64\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 3, plot every 4-th 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 point at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 point 32, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

 point 64 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{4\}=\{0,2:4:48,0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 4, plot every 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 point , every 4-th 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 point, and all 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

-points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Points labelled 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 indicates a default `typical' point, which is the midpoint.
 If one uses 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

, this is the last point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lower dimensions are replaced by corresponding higher dimensions if there
 are 
\emph on
dimensions
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
axes
\emph default
 that are suppressed.
 Slices can be taken at any desired point, not just the midpoint.
 The notation of 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{6:3:81\}$
\end_inset

, is used to modify the starting, interval, and finishing points for complete
 control on the plot points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics results depend on the resulting 
\series bold
effective
\series default
 dimension, which is equal to the actual input data dimension unless there
 is an 
\emph on
axes
\emph default
 suppression, described above.
 Since the plot has to include a data axis, the plot itself will usually
 have an extra data axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can plot only three axes directly using standard graphics tools.
 The strategy to deal with the higher effective dimensionality is as follows.
 For simplicity, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used to label the first effective dimension, although in fact any first
 dimension is possible:

 A movie of distinct 2D graphic plots is also possible.
 Otherwise, a slice through

\begin_layout Standard
As explained above, in addition to graphs versus

 the

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars, sampling errors and multiple lines for comparisons are only
 graphed for 2D plots.
 Error-bars are not plotted when they are below a user-specified size, with
 a default of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 of the maximum range, to improve graphics quality.
 Higher dimensional graphs do not output error-bar data, but they are still
 recorded in the data files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Probabilities and parametric plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probability data can be input and plotted like any other data.
 It is typically generated from simulation programs using the 
\begin_inset Formula $binranges$
\end_inset

 data for binning.
 It is plotted like any other graph, with any dimension, except that the
 total dimension is extended by the number of variables or lines in the
 
\emph on

\emph default
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Chi-squared plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition the program can make a
\emph on
 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 plot, which is a plot of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 comparison with a comparison probability density against space and/or time.
 This allows a test of the simulated data against a known target probability
 distribution, provided that the following input data conditions are satisfied:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The input data dimension exceeds the p.
\emph on

\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The switch p.

or 2, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The input data includes comparison function data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The
\emph on
 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 plots, depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $p.chisqplot$
\end_inset

 are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of valid data points, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2\chi^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2k-1}$
\end_inset

, which should have a unit variance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, for one point in space and time, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}$
\end_inset

 counts per bin and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 expected counts: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{\left(N_{j}-E_{j}\right)^{2}}{E_{j}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of valid counts, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j},E_{j}>mincount$
\end_inset

.
 This is partly determined from the requirement that the probability count
 data per bin is greater than the 
\begin_inset Formula $p.mincount$
\end_inset

 parameter.
 The default is set to give a number of samples 
\begin_inset Formula $>10$
\end_inset

.
 The program prints a summary that sums over of all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $p.scale\{n\}$
\end_inset

 parameter gives the number of counts per bin at unit probability density.
 This is needed to set the scale of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 results, ie, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}=scale\{n\}\times p_{j}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the probability density that is compared and plotted in the simulation
 data.
 Note that a uniform bin size is assumed here, to give a uniform scaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparisons with variances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be useful to compare two probability distributions with different
 variances.
 For one point in space and time, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 probability density and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{j}$
\end_inset

 expected probability density, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{\left(p_{j}-e_{j}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{j}^{2}+\sigma_{e,j}^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e,j}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are the sampling errors in the simulation data and comparison data, so
 that built-in error fields in the data are used to work out the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 results.
 This option is chosen if 
\begin_inset Formula $p.scale\{n\}=0$
\end_inset

, and the cutoff for the data is then specified so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j},e_{j}>p.cutoffs\{n\}$
\end_inset

.
 This only has a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution if points are independent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Maximum likelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to plot the 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{2}$
\end_inset

 or maximum likelihood plot of the data, which is an alternative means to
 compare distributions, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G^{2}=2\sum_{j=1}^{m}N_{j}\ln\left(N_{j}/E_{j}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The expected values 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are automatically scaled so that

\begin_layout Subsection
Parametric plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any input dataset can be converted to a parametric plot, where a second
 data input is plotted along the horizontal axis instead of the time coordinate.
 It is also possible to substitute a second data input for the x-axis data
 if a parametric plot in space is required instead.
 This allows visualization of how one type of data changes as a function
 of a second type of data input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two datasets that are plotted must have the same number of lines, that
 is, the first index range should be the same, in order that multiple lines
 can be compared.
 This is achieved where required using the 
\emph on
p.scatters
\emph default
 input in the simulation code.
 The details of the parametric plot are specified using the input: 
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p.parametric\{n\}=[n1,p2]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the graph number which is plotted, and must correspond to an input dataset.
 The number 
\begin_inset Formula $n1$
\end_inset

 is the graph number of the observable that is plotted on the horizontal
 axis, ignoring functional transformations.
 The second number is the axis number where the parametric value is substituted,
 which can be the time (axis 1) or the x-coordinate (axis 2), if present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases the vertical axis is used to plot the original data.
 The specified horizontal axis is used for the parametric variable.
 Only vertical error-bars are available.
 An example is given in xAMPLES/SDE_1/SHO, which is a noise-driven harmonic
 oscillator, with several lines plotted of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 vs

 plots every fourth point.
 Single points generate graphics projections, allowing the other dimensions
 to be plotted.
 Zero or negative values are shorthand.
 For example,

 All the graphs produced are deleted.
 It lists the different examples available, some of which are given below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The batch testing code will run each different example sequentially.
 It prints the RMS relative errors for the step-size, sampling and difference
 error, as well as the total RMS error combining all three, the chi-square
 error normalised by the number of points, and the timing.
 The geometric mean of the 
\begin_inset Formula $35$
\end_inset

 RMS total errors is computed as a benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Matlab random noise is reproducible with a fixed seed, this geometric
 mean error is fixed.
 The total is printed to more than six decimals for verification, and an
 error is indicated if it varies by a factor of more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm10^{-3}$
\end_inset

.
 Due to different random noise algorithms used in some Octave versions,
 the Octave error may vary by up to

Planar noise growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This solves a (1+2)-dimensional PSDE describing the growth of noise in a
 planar vector field with a diffraction term giving rise to noise dispersion.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $240$
\end_inset

 trajectories in the total ensemble.
 The equation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t} & = & \frac{i}{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}\right)\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{\eta}\left(t,x\right)\,.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The initial conditions are that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\left(\mathbf{v}_{x}+i\mathbf{v}_{y}\right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, where: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle v_{i}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)v_{j}\left(\mathbf{x}'\right)\right\rangle =\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)\delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

the noise correlations are that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\eta}=\left(\mathbf{w}_{x}+i\mathbf{w}_{y}\right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle w_{i}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)w_{j}\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)\right\rangle  & = & \delta\left(t-t'\right)\delta_{ij}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\right)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution has periodic boundary conditions.
 The noise correlations for the second field are specified in momentum space.
 As there are no filters specified, the noise terms are delta-correlated
 in both momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

) and in space (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 The exact results for comparison for the correlations within each field
 are similar in position and momentum space: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle \left|a_{i}\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle  & =\left(1+t\right)/\Delta A_{x}.\nonumber \\
\left\langle \left|a_{i}\left(t,\mathbf{k}\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle  & =\left(1+t\right)/\Delta A_{k}.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{x,k}$
\end_inset

 is the area of a lattice cell in space or momentum space respectively.
 This is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{x}=1/49$
\end_inset

 for the parameters used here.
 On integration, the correlation is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

, the number of points in the spatial lattice, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $35^{2}=1225$
\end_inset

 for the spatial lattice used here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\int\left\langle \left|a_{i}\left(t,\mathbf{x}\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle d\mathbf{x}=\int\left\langle \left|a_{i}\left(t,\mathbf{k}\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle d\mathbf{k} & =N_{s}\left(1+t\right).
\end{align}

Gross-Pitaevskii equation with vortex formation

This solves a (1+2)-dimensional PDE called the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
 In addition to the standard GPE terms, it includes the vortex forming term

 There is just one ensemble member, to demonstrate how a single trajectory
 can be imaged.
 The equation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} & = & \left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2}a-\left\Vert \left(\left(V\left(\mathbf{x}\right)+200\left|a\right|^{2}\right)+0.6i\cdot\left(\mathbf{x}\times\nabla\right)\right)a\right\Vert \right)\nonumber \\
V\left(\mathbf{x}\right) & = & 0.35\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\nonumber \\
\left\Vert b\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\right\Vert  & = & \frac{b\left(\mathbf{x}\right)}{\int\left|b\right|^{2}d\mathbf{x}}\,.

\begin_layout Standard
This very simple example solves a (1+1)-dimensional PDE with an initial
 condition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\left(t=0,x\right)=\mathbf{f}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{a}}{\partial t} & = & \frac{\partial^{2}\mathbf{a}}{\partial x^{2}}\,.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The solution is subject to periodic boundary conditions or Dirichlet and/or
 Neumann with boundary values at zero, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(t,\pm x_{m}\right)=0\,$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial a/\partial x\left(t,\pm x_{m}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Each component has different combinations of boundary types.
 Using spectral methods the solutions here are exact, up to round-off errors
 of order 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-15}$
\end_inset

, and are also much faster than with finite differences, which is demonstrated
 in the example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases the grid range is from 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$

\end_inset

 and the time duration is from 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=4$
\end_inset

.
 In the examples, the spectral propagation error is reduced by more than
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{10}$
\end_inset

 and the time is reduced by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 compared to the finite-difference methods.
 The periodic method has boundaries just outside the grid.

This solves a Lindblad master equation for nonlinear decay with two modes
 and two decay channels.
 The initial condition is 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{j}=\delta_{Nj}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}=a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}=a^{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $N=[3,6]$

The decay rates are:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_{1} & =[0.01,0.01]\\
\gamma_{2} & =[.5,.25],
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 The function uses the MPS algorithm with the SSE derivative, and has real
 noise terms.
 The sparse and functional methods give identical results, but the sparse
 method is faster.
