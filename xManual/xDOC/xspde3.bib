@article{Molmer1993monte,
	abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

	abstract = {Finding the optimum solution of multiparameter or multifunctional problems is important across many disciplines, but it can be computationally intensive. Many such problems defined as computationally difficult can be mathematically mapped onto the so-called Ising problem, which looks at finding the minimum energy configuration for an array of coupled spins. Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems. Such a scalable architecture could help to optimize solutions to a wide range of complex problems.Science, this issue pp. 603 and 614The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.},

The superconducting correlations of the dx2-y2 wave symmetry in the ground state at distance r decays essentially as inverse cubic of r. The upper bound of the correlation at long distances estimated by this unbiased method is 0.001, indicating that recent extensions of dynamical mean-field theories and variational methods yielded at least an order of magnitude overestimates of it.

This class is realized by putting a metallic quantum dot in contact with a superconductor, while applying a magnetic field so as to make the pairing field effectively vanish on average. A random-matrix description of the spectral and transport properties of such a quantum dot is proposed. The weak-localization correction to the tunnel conductance is nonzero and results from the depletion of the density of states due to the coupling with the superconductor. Semiclassically, the depletion is caused by a singular mode of phase-coherent long-range propagation of particles and holes.},

The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential!
  functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

In general, a priori unknown states can be completely determined only when measurements on infinite ensembles of identically prepared quantum systems are performed. But how one can estimate (guess) quantum state when just incomplete data are available (known)? What is the most reliable estimation based on a given measured data? What is the optimal measurement providing only a finite number of identically prepared quantum objects are available? These are some of the questions we address. We present several schemes for a reconstruction of states of quantum systems from measured data: (1) We show how the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle can be efficiently used for an estimation of quantum states on incomplete observation levels. (2) We show how Bayesian inference can be used for reconstruct!
 ion of quantum states when only a finite number of identically prepared systems are measured. (3) We describe the optimal generalized measurement of a finite number of identically prepared quantum systems which results in the estimation of a quantum state with the highest fidelity. },

	abstract = {In this paper the equations for quantum optical pulse propagation in nonlinear and dispersive single-mode fibers are presented in terms of two phase-space formulations based on the positive-P and the Wigner distributions. Included are the effects due to the coupling of the electromagnetic modes to the vibrational states of a vitreous silica fiber. By making use of the well-known equivalence of Fokker-Planck and Ito stochastic equations, we demonstrate two alternative methods for formulating the equations of motion as coupled stochastic c-number equations for the propagating field. The first method involves a representation of the density operator in terms of the positive P distribution function. This leads to exact stochastic equations of motion. The second method makes use of the Wigner distribution function. This method, which requires truncation of third-order derivative terms in the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, is necessarily approximate. However, w!
 e discuss certain advantages to the Wigner approach that have made it the preferable method for exploratory work.},

The method works uniformly for both continuous Cartesian degrees of freedom and for systems with finite-dimensional state spaces. It is interesting that the kernel encountered is naturally expressible in terms of geometric phases, and its removal involves extracting its square root in a suitable manner.},

Phase and amplitude fluctuations in the driving field are taken into account to model a partially coherent multimode source. The photon statistics of the light in the cavity are investigated through a calculation of the second-order correlation function of the light field in the steady state. For a coherent driving field the field inside the cavity will exhibit photon antibunching for low intensities. As the fluctuations in the driving field are increased the photon antibunching is lost. For a particular coherent field, g (2) (0) is reduced with increasing laser intensity. This reduction with laser intensity is slower with increasing laser amplitude fluctuations. This could provide a possible explanation for the recent experimental observations of Kransinski and Dinev (1976).},

In situations where the quasiprobability distributions are singular, these distributions are shown to provide regularized versions thereof. The positive distribution introduced by Drummond and Gardiner (1981) in the context of the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation is shown to arise as a special case. One can thus associate a positive distribution to the Wigner function such that its moments give the averages of Weyl-ordered operators with respect to the given density operator. It is also found that one can associate to the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function, a distribution in the extended space which, though not positive, interestingly, involves the Wigner function (1932). A measurement scheme which directly yields these positive distributions is presented.},

We find that the optimal noise reduction occurs at different driving fields, depending on the ratio of damping rates. The largest spectral noise reductions are predicted to occur with a very high-Q second-harmonic cavity. Our analytic results agree well with stochastic numerical simulations.

@article{Clauser1978Bell,
	abstract = {Bell's theorem represents a significant advance in understanding the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics. The theorem shows that essentially all local theories of natural phenomena that are formulated within the framework of realism may be tested using a single experimental arrangement. Moreover, the predictions by those theories must significantly differ from those by quantum mechanics. Experimental results evidently refute the theorem's predictions for these theories and favour those of quantum mechanics. The conclusions are philosophically startling: either one must totally abandon the realistic philosophy of most working scientists, or dramatically revise out concept of space-time.},

Using both soliton perturbation theory and exact numerical techniques, we propose that intrinsic thermal quantum noise from the phonon reservoirs is a larger source of jitter and other perturbations than the gain-related Gordon-Haus noise for short pulses (less than or similar to1 ps), assuming typical fiber parameters. The size of the Raman timing jitter is evaluated for both bright and dark (topological) solitons and is larger for bright solitons. Because Raman thermal quantum noise is a nonlinear, multiplicative noise source, these effects are stronger for the more intense pulses that are needed to propagate as solitons in the short-pulse regime. Thus Raman noise may place additional limitations on fiber-optical communications and networking by use of ultrafast (subpicosecond) pulses.},

In particular, samples of ground-state molecules at ultralow temperatures and high number densities will allow novel quantum-gas studies and future applications in quantum information science. However, high phase-space densities for molecular samples are not readily attainable as efficient cooling techniques such as laser cooling are lacking. Here we produce an ultracold and dense sample of molecules in a single hyperfine level of the rovibronic ground state with each molecule individually trapped in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well. Starting from a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state with optimized double-site occupancy, weakly-bound dimer molecules are efficiently associated on a Feshbach resonance and subsequently transferred to the rovibronic ground stat!

@article{Dechoum2004Critical,
	abstract = {We present a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator both below and near threshold. This is a nonequilibrium quantum system with a critical point phase transition, that is also known to exhibit strong yet easily observed squeezing and quantum entanglement. Our treatment makes use of the positive P representation and goes beyond the usual linearized theory. We compare our analytical results with numerical simulations and find excellent agreement. We also carry out a detailed comparison of our results with those obtained from stochastic electrodynamics, a theory obtained by truncating the equation of motion for the Wigner function, with a view to locating regions of agreement and disagreement between the two. We calculate commonly used measures of quantum behavior including entanglement, squeezing, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations as well as higher order tripartite correlations, and show how these are mod!
 ified as the critical point is approached. These results are compared with those obtained using two degenerate parametric oscillators, and we find that in the near-critical region the nondegenerate oscillator has stronger EPR correlations. In general, the critical fluctuations represent an ultimate limit to the possible entanglement that can be achieved in a nondegenerate parametric oscillator.},

@article{Dellanno2006Multiphoton,
	abstract = {We present a review of theoretical and experimental aspects of multiphoton quantum optics. Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects of matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms; system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics, optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and atoms that are relevant for the conceptual investigations as well as for the practical applications of forefront aspects of modern quantum mechanics. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and t!
 he corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states, and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton entangled states of the electromagnetic field, either in discrete or in continuous variables, that are relevant for applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and related problems in quantum communication an!

	abstract = {This paper presents a correspondence between the annihilation $\hat{a}$ and creation $\hat{a}^\dagger$ operators and two independent complex variables {\^I}$\pm$ and {\^I}², which makes possible the definition of positive nondiagonal quasiprobabilities for any Cahill-Glauber s order. A generalized version of the Cahill and Glauber s-ordered displacement operator displacing the annihilation and creation operators by {\^I}$\pm$ and {\^I}² is defined. Corresponding to this n/Inondiagonal displacement, a nondiagonal ordering operator is introduced so that a map of s-ordered operators into c numbers $\hat{a}${\^a}{\^I}$\pm$, $\hat{a}^\dagger{\^a}{\^I}²$ can be defined. The Drummond-Gardiner projector and the Cahill-Glauber diagonal ordering operator are obtained as particular cases. In order to use the nondiagonal correspondence in the determination of quantum expectation values of observables, several families of quasiprobabilities are defined, generalizing Drummond-Gardiner (normal order and nondiagonal)!
  positive-P-function and Cahill-Glauber (s-order and diagonal) quasiprobabilities. It is demonstrated that these nondiagonal quasiprobabilities exist as well-behaved functions where at least one is non-negative, for any state and any order. The time evolution of these quasiprobabilities is discussed both in the Schr{\"o}dinger and in the Heisenberg pictures. In the Heisenberg picture, a method for obtaining c-number stochastic differential equations (SDE's) directly from operator equations using the s-order nondiagonal correspondence is described. The main difference between this method and the Langevin approach is that in the latter a diagonal correspondence is used, leading eventually to wrong results. The use of these SDE's to solve quantum optical problems is discussed, and an application to the nonlinearly damped degenerate parametric oscillator is made. In order to obtain the SDE, various (inequivalent) truncation schemes are necessary.},

Our treatment results in an infinite set of possible time evolution equations, depending on arbitrary gauge functions that can be optimized for a given quantum system. In some cases, previous methods can give erroneous results, due to the usual assumption of vanishing boundary conditions being invalid for those particular systems. Solutions are given to this boundary-term problem for all the cases where it is known to occur: two-photon absorption and the single-mode laser. We also provide some brief guidelines on how to apply the stochastic gauge method to other systems in general, quantify the freedom of choice in the resulting equatio!

An expression for the useful simulation time is obtained, and checked in numerical simulations. The dynamics of first-, second- and third-order spatial correlations are calculated for a uniform interacting 1D Bose gas subjected to a change in scattering length. Propagation of correlations is seen. A comparison is made with other recent methods.

One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume $(2 \pi \hbar )^3$, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and o!
 ne may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there. },

We then set up the preliminary steps to prepare for the simulations, showing that they are actually carried out by sampling discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. In this process the Green's function emerges as a fundamental tool, since it is used in the updating process, and, at the same time, it is directly related to the quantities probing magnetic, charge, metallic, and superconducting behaviours. We also discuss the as yet unresolved {\^A}minus-sign problem', and two ways to stabilize the algorithm at low temperatures.},

We investigate two systems in particular of much current experimental interest, namely the degenerate parametric oscillator near threshold, and the evaporatively cooled (BEC).

	abstract = {Poisson representation techniques provide a powerful method for mapping master equations for birth/death processes -- found in many fields of physics, chemistry and biology -- into more tractable stochastic differential equations. However, the usual expansion is not exact in the presence of boundary terms, which commonly occur when the differential equations are nonlinear. In this paper, a gauge Poisson technique is introduced that eliminates boundary terms, to give an exact representation as a weighted rate equation with stochastic terms. These methods provide novel techniques for calculating and understanding the effects of number correlations in systems that have a master equation description. As examples, correlations induced by strong mutations in genetics, and the astrophysical problem of molecule formation on microscopic grain surfaces are analyzed. Exact analytic results are obtained that can be compared with numerical simulations, demonstrating that sto!

This results in the standard quantum limit, which is reached in today's best available sensors of various quantities such as time(2) and position(3,4). Many of these sensors are interferometers in which the standard quantum limit can be overcome by using quantum-entangled states (in particular spin squeezed states(5,6)) at the two input ports. Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms are considered good candidates to provide such states involving a large number of particles. Here we demonstrate spin squeezed states suitable for atomic interferometry by splitting a condensate into a few parts using a lattice potential. Site-resolved detection of the atoms allows the measurement of the atom number difference and relative phase, which are conjugate variables. The observed fluctuatio!
 ns imply entanglement between the particles(7-9), a resource that would allow a precision gain of 3.8 dB over the standard quantum limit for interferometric measurements.},

On-demand single-electron injection in a quantum conductor was obtained using a quantum dot connected to the conductor via a tunnel barrier.

Depending on the barrier transparency, the quantum emission time ranged from 0.1 to 10 nanoseconds. The single-electron source should prove useful for the use of quantum bits in ballistic conductors. Additionally, periodic sequences of single-electron emission and absorption generate a quantized alternating current.},

HBT correlations, together with their fermionic counterparts find numerous applications, ranging from quantum optics to nuclear and elementary particle physics. Spatial HBT interferometry has been suggested as a means to probe hidden order in strongly correlated phases of ultracold atoms. Here we report such a measurement on the Mott insulator phase of a rubidium Bose gas as it is released from an optical lattice trap. We show that strong periodic quantum correlations exist between density fluctuations in the expanding atom cloud. These spatial correlations reflect the underlying ordering in the lattice, and find a natural interpretation in terms of a multiple-wav!
 e HBT interference effect. The method should provide a useful tool for identifying complex quantum phases of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new technique for handling chemical master equations, based on an expansion of the probability distribution in Poisson distributions. This enables chemical master equations to be transformed into Fokker-Planck and stochastic differential equations and yields very simple descriptions of chemical equilibrium states. Certain nonequilibrium systems are investigated and the results are compared with those obtained previously. The Gaussian approximation is investigated and is found to be valid almost always, except near critical points. The stochastic differential equations derived have a few novel features, such as the possibility of pure imaginary noise terms and the possibility of higher order noise, which do not seem to have been previously studied by physicists. These features are allowable because the transform of the probability distribution is a quasiprobability, which may be negative or even complex.},

@article{Gilles1997Isotropic,
	abstract = {The degenerate parametric oscillator above threshold is studied with phenomenological stochastic colored (nonwhite) pump noise for arbitrary pump to subharmonic relaxation rate. The current experimental limits of large intracavity threshold photon numbers (very small quantum noise) are considered, allowing for a semiclassical treatment of the system dynamics. A comparison between the effects of isotropic and squeezed pump noise on the internal transient and steady-state fluctuations is presented by simulation of the nonlinear semiclassical stochastic Langevin equations in the Wigner quadrature representation. It is found that the transient squeezing for the system starting in the unstable steady state (the vacuum) is not degraded by stochastic pump noise. A damped oscillatory behavior of the noise levels (periodic exchange of fluctuations between the squeezed quadrature of the signal and the pump) is observed for large damping of the signal in the turn on of pum!
 p depletion. Finally, it is shown that the limited squeezing above threshold in the steady state (50\%) due to pump depletion can be enhanced if squeezed stochastic noise with sufficient significant spectral components (broadband squeezing) is fed to the pump. The above-threshold steady-state squeezing has been calculated analytically from the linearized stochastic equations and the effects of the time scale associated to the relaxation of the pump noise (the noise correlation time) compared to the dissipative time scale of the system and the pump to subharmonic loss ratio are presented. },

@article{Grond2010Atom,
	abstract = {Interferometry with ultracold atoms promises the possibility of ultraprecise and ultrasensitive measurements in many fields of physics, and is the basis of our most precise atomic clocks. Key to a high sensitivity is the possibility to achieve long measurement times and precise readout. Ultracold atoms can be precisely manipulated at the quantum level and can be held for very long times in traps; they would therefore be an ideal setting for interferometry. In this paper, we discuss how the nonlinearities from atom-atom interactions, on the one hand, allow us to efficiently produce squeezed states for enhanced readout and, on the other hand, result in phase diffusion that limits the phase accumulation time. We find that low-dimensional geometries are favorable, with two-dimensional (2D) settings giving the smallest contribution of phase diffusion caused by atom-atom interactions. Even for time sequences generated by optimal control, the achievable minimal detecta!
 ble interaction energy $\Delta E^{min}$ is of the order of $10^{-4} \mu$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in the trap. From these we have to conclude that for more precise measurements with atom interferometers, more sophisticated strategies, or turning off the interaction-induced dephasing during the phase accumulation stage, will be necessary.},

We show that the atomic interactions affect the quantum statistics of the resulting field, although they do not interfere with the production of the MBEC. We demonstrate that STIRAP is still feasible when we include the spatial degrees of freedom that cause the Bose-enhanced coupling rate to vary across the condensate. The complete conversion is destroyed by spatial effects unless the time scale of the coupling is much faster than the propagation time, which in practice requires submillisecond conversion.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes general properties of pupils with nonuniform real or complex amplitude distributions. These general properties are relevant to apodisation. In most optical problems, it is usual to consider only the central part of the diffraction pattern produced by an optical system as the image of a luminous point. In fact, this central part determines the principal performance characteristics of the system, in particular its ability to resolve two equally bright object points. This also determines the spatial frequency transmission curve in the medium frequencies region. In the study of linear structures and in spectroscopy, where the image is that of a slit, it is desirable that the pupil should have a complex amplitude distribution, which is constant along any parallel to the linear direction in the object. A similar situation occurs in the study of polar diagrams of antennae. These are called ``rectilinear cases.''},

@article{Jeltes2007Comparison,
	abstract = {Fifty years ago, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) discovered photon bunching in light emitted by a chaotic source, highlighting the importance of two-photon correlations and stimulating the development of modern quantum optics. The quantum interpretation of bunching relies on the constructive interference between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterization of the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms. By contrast, fermions should reveal an antibunching effect (a tendency to avoid each other). Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle interference, and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an experimental comparison of the fermionic and bosonic HBT effects in th!
 e same apparatus, using two different isotopes of helium: 3He (a fermion) and 4He (a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are negligible; therefore, the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviour that we observe can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species. Our results show how atom--atom correlation measurements can be used to reveal details in the spatial density or momentum correlations in an atomic ensemble. They also enable the direct observation of phase effects linked to the quantum statistics of a many-body system, which may facilitate the study of more exotic situations.},

This approach allows us to include material dispersion, diffraction, and nonlinearity.

This allows us to calculate asymptotically the size of both the depletion of the pump mode and the amount of squeezing produced in the signal mode for large system size. In this driven, open quantum system, there is no known solution to the equilibrium density matrix. For this reason these results cannot be obtained using standard canonical ensemble methods. The calculations are compared to time dependent quantum stochastic simulations of the fully nonlinear coupled mode equations. We find that the critical squeezing variance in the output spectrum will scale as N-1/2, giving the feature that these fluctuations are reduced rather than enhanced near the critical point.},

We directly image the Fermi surface of the atoms in the lattice by turning off the optical lattice adiabatically. Because of the confining potential, gradual filling of the lattice transforms the system from a normal state into a band insulator. The dynamics of the transition from a band insulator to a normal state is studied, and the time scale is measured to be an order of magnitude larger than the tunneling time in the lattice. Using a Feshbach resonance, we increase the interaction between atoms in two different spin states and dynamically induce a coupling between the lowest energy bands. We observe a shift of this coupling with respect to the Feshbach resonance in free space which is anticipated for strongly confined atoms.},

@article{Korolkova2002Polarization,
	abstrct = {A concept of polarization entanglement for continuous variables is introduced. For this purpose the Stokes-parameter operators and the associated Poincar{\'e} sphere, which describe the quantum-optical polarization properties of light, are defined and their basic properties are reviewed. The general features of the Stokes operators are illustrated by evaluation of their means and variances for a range of simple polarization states. Some of the examples show polarization squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller than the coherent-state value. The main object of the paper is the application of these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam formed by interference of two orthogonally polarized quadrature-squeezed beams exhibits squeezing in some of the Stokes parameters. Passage of such a primary polarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair of polarization-entangled light ! beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed state. Implementation of these schemes using the double-fiber Sagnac interferometer provides an efficient method for the generation of bright nonclassical polarization states. The important advantage of these nonclassical polarization states for quantum communication is the possibility of experimentally determining all of the relevant conjugate variables of both squeezed and entangled fields using only linear optical elements followed by direct detection.},

We investigate this possibility by performing numerical simulations of quantum stochastic equations derived using the positive P representation. The equations allow for finite signal cavity loss. Interference fringes which indicate the existence of the macroscopic superposition states are indeed predicted in regimes where the parametric nonlinearity is sufficiently large compared to the signal cavity losses. Experimental criteria needed for the generation of macroscopic quantum superposition states using parametric oscillation are thus established.},

For stationary structure calculations, the coupled-cluster (CC) method overcomes the COD in the sense that the method scales polynomially with the number of particles while still being size-consistent and extensive. We generalize the CC method to the time domain while allowing the single-particle functions to vary in an adaptive fashion as well, thereby creating a highly flexible, polynomially scaling approximation to the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The method inherits size-consistency and extensivity from the CC method. The method is dubbed orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster, and is a hierarchy of approximations to the now standard multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for fermions. A numerical experiment is also given.},

Quite a few Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms have been developed in the meantime. Although they are very different in technical details, the basic ideas are very similar in all of them. The purpose of this review article is twofold. Firstly, we will give an overview of the most commonly used Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. It will give enough background to understand the principles of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, the most important physical results for many-body problems in solid state physics, obtained by QMC simulations, will be presented.

Simple relations between the complex and positive P functions are discovered for the first time. Various moments calculated by using these distributions are found to be identical, as expected. An application of these distributions to the two-photon correlated-emission laser shows that the intracavity field can be near-perfectly squeezed in the phase quadrature and the maximum quadrature squeezing is reached when the mean laser amplitude vanishes.},

@article{Mandel1965Coherence,
	abstract = {This article presents a review of coherence properties of electromagnetic fields and their measurements, with special emphasis on the optical region of the spectrum. Analyses based on both the classical and quantum theories are described. After a brief historical introduction, the elementary concepts which are frequently employed in the discussion of interference phenomena are summarized. The measure of second-order coherence is then introduced in connection with the analysis of a simple interference experiment and some of the more important second-order coherence effects are studied. Their uses in stellar interferometry and interference spectroscopy are described. Analysis of partial polarization from the standpoint of correlation theory is also outlined. The general statistical description of the field is discussed in some detail. The recently discovered universal \textquotedblleft diagonal  \textquotedblright  representation of the density operator for free f!
 ields is also considered and it is shown how, with the help of the associated generalized phase-space distribution function, the quantum-mechanical correlation functions may be expressed in the same form as the classical ones. The sections which follow deal with the statistical properties of thermal and nonthermal light, and with the temporal and spatial coherence of blackbody radiation. Later sections, dealing with fourth- and higher-order coherence effects include a discussion of the photoelectric detection process. Among the fourth-order effects described in detail are bunching phenomena, the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and its application to astronomy. The article concludes with a discussion of various transient superposition effects, such as light beats and interference fringes produced by independent light beams.},

Entanglement for arbitrary quantum observables for multipartite systems is discussed. Star-product kernels are used to map the formulation of the addition rule of density operators onto the addition rule of symbols of the operators. Entanglement and nonlocalization of the pure state projector and allied operators are discussed. Tomographic and Weyl symbols (tomograms and Wigner functions) are considered as examples.

Quantum tomography is formulated in an abstract Hilbert space framework, by means of decompositions of the identity in the Hilbert space of hermitian linear operators, with trace formula as scalar product of operators. Decompositions of the identity are considered with respect to over-complete families of projectors labeled by extra parameters and containing a measure, depending on these parameters. It plays the role of a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization kernel. When the measure is equal to one, the decomposition of identity coincides with a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) decomposition. Examples of spin tomography, photon number tomography and symplectic tomography are reconsidered in this new framework.},

	abstract = {The problem of the formulation and simulation of quantized optical systems using the positive-P representation is considered. We show that feasible computational strategies are determined mainly by the eigenstructure of the system of stochastic differential equations that correspond to the positive-P Fokker-Planck equation. We demonstrate analytically that the stability and accuracy of numerical solutions are generally much improved by adopting time-centered implicit schemes. These findings are then related to the specific problem of second-harmonic generation. It is shown that the eigenstructure of the stochastic system possesses interrelationships that can lead to severe difficulties in numerical simulations. In particular we show how the problem of ``spiking'' encountered at high levels of quantum noise can be related to the numerical ``stiffness'' of the problem. We also demonstrate the advantages of time-centered implicit methods by highlighting the distort!
 ions that can occur in the Euler-type simulation of limit cycle solutions. Of physical interest is the fact that the phase-space morphology of the quantized second-harmonic generator admits families of limit cycles. This is in marked contrast to the purely classical picture in which, for a given parameter set, there exists only a single limit cycle. Finally we demonstrate by direct analytic solution that, under the conditions of adiabatic elimination, the positive-P representation for the second-harmonic generator with zero driving field fails, in the sense that it produces nonphysical results. This failure is in all respects analogous to the breakdown encountered in the problem of nonlinear optical damping.},

	abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a quantum joint phase-space probability density in an exactly solvable model. The density is defined to be a true (i.e., positive) probability distribution for approximate (and thus simultaneously measurable) position and momentum variables. The dynamics of the quantum density is governed by a second-order partial-differential equation with non-positive-definite second-order coefficients. The quantum dynamics is contrasted with the dynamics of a similar joint density in a classical description. The non-positive-definite second-order terms in the quantum evolution equation, not present in the classical case, are responsible for quantum recurrences and prevent the appearance of fine-scale-structure   \textquotedblleft whorls  \textquotedblright predicted in a classical description. The generation of \textquotedblleft squeezing  \textquotedblright in the model is also discussed.},

After explaining why these two sets are equivalent, we explore some properties and applications of the second one. Among other things, we show that that set includes the position-momentum uncertainty relations as a special case, and in doing so we give a new derivation of them. This derivation itself serves as the starting point for the discussion of a quantum-mechanical moment problem. It also enables us to exhibit a real-valued phase-space function that obeys the uncertainty relations but that is not a WDF.},

This is carried out by means of quasi-classical distribution functions and here we address the question of which is the best choice of function from the large selection available. Whereas Glauber's P(agr) distribution is useful in many applications, it does not exist as a well-behaved function in many others. In such cases, a more useful function is the generalized P-representation of Drummond and Gardiner. However, based on simplicity and overall applicability, we conclude that Wigner's function also has a claim to be the optimum choice.},

Using the undepleted molecular-field approximation, we obtain explicit analytic results for the asymptotic behavior of the second-order correlation functions and for the relative number squeezing between the dissociated atoms in one, two and three spatial dimensions. Comparison with the numerical results shows that the analytic approach employed here captures the main underlying physics and provides useful insights into the dynamics of dissociation for conversion efficiencies up to 10{\%}.

We analyse the application of the Gaussian phase-space representation to the dynamics of the dissociation of an ultra-cold molecular gas. We show how the choice of mapping to stochastic differential equations can be used to tailor the stochastic behaviour, and thus the useful simulation time. In the phase-space approach, it is only averages of stochastic trajectories that have a direct physical meaning. Whether particular constants of the motion are satisfied by individual trajectories depends on the choice of mapping, as we show in examples.},

	abstract = {We perform a quantum-mechanical analysis of the pendular cavity, using the positive-P representation, showing that the quantum state of the moving mirror, a macroscopic object, has noticeable effects on the dynamics. This system has previously been proposed as a candidate for the quantum-limited measurement of small displacements of the mirror due to radiation pressure, for the production of states with entanglement between the mirror and the field, and even for superposition states of the mirror. However, when we treat the oscillating mirror quantum mechanically, we find that it always oscillates, has no stationary steady state, and exhibits uncertainties in position and momentum which are typically larger than the mean values. This means that previous linearized fluctuation analyses which have been used to predict these highly quantum states are of limited use. We find that the achievable accuracy in measurement is far worse than the standard quantum limit due!

This transformation is based on a dynamical ordering of quantum quasiprobability distribution functions. The ordering depends on the parameters of the dynamical problem under consideration. An algorithm leading to exact solutions of the dynamically ordered Fokker-Planck equations with arbitrary initial conditions is given, and simple criteria, how to recognize squeezed light in arbitrary ordering, are presented. The problem of Fokker-Planck equations with time-dependent diffusion is also investigated.},

	abstract = {Path integral representations of quantum dynamics can often be formulated as stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In a series of papers, Corney and Drummond (2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 260401), Deuar and Drummond (2001 Comput. Phys. Commun. 142 442-5), Drummond and Gardnier ( 1980 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 13, 2353-68), Gardiner and Zoller (2004 Quantum Noise: A Handbook of Markovian and Non-Markovian Quantum Stochastic Methods with Applications to Quantum Optics ( Springer Series in Synergetics ) 3rd edn (Berlin: Springer)) and Gilchrist et al (1997 Phys. Rev. A 55 3014-32) and their collaborators have derived SDEs from coherent states representations for density matrices. Computationally, these SDEs are attractive because they seem simple to simulate. They can be quite unstable, however. In this paper, we consider some of the instabilities and propose a few remedies. Particularly, because the variances of the simulated paths typically grow exponentially, the p!
 rocesses become de-localized in relatively short times. Hence, the issues of boundary conditions and stable integration methods become important. We use the Bose-Einstein Hamiltonian as an example. Our results reveal that it is possible to significantly extend integration times and show the periodic structure of certain functionals.},

	abstract = {This is a review of recent developments in Monte Carlo methods in the field of ultracold gases. For bosonic atoms in an optical lattice we discuss path-integral Monte Carlo simulations with worm updates and show the excellent agreement with cold atom experiments. We also review recent progress in simulating bosonic systems with long-range interactions, disordered bosons, mixtures of bosons and spinful bosonic systems. For repulsive fermionic systems, determinantal methods at half filling are sign free, but in general no sign-free method exists. We review the developments in diagrammatic Monte Carlo for the Fermi polaron problem and the Hubbard model, and show the connection with dynamical mean-field theory. We end the review with diffusion Monte Carlo for the Stoner problem in cold gases.},

The process is not amenable to the usual mean-field description, and we base our analysis on approximate equations for the second moments of the atomic field operators and on Monte Carlo simulations derived from a positive-P phase-space description of the system. Our calculations show that the dissociation process produces an atomic condensate in a squeezed state in analogy with the down-conversion process leading to squeezed light in quantum optics. Atomic interactions lead to a threshold similar to the one in optical down-conversion, and to an atomic ``Kerr'' effect, which ultimately deteriorates the degree of squeezing.},

A trapped gas of fermionic K-40 atoms is evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy and then a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to control the atom-atom interactions.

In order to search for condensation on either side of the resonance, we introduce a technique that pairwise projects fermionic atoms onto molecules; this enables us to measure the momentum distribution of fermionic atom pairs. The transition to condensation of fermionic atom pairs is mapped out as a function of the initial atom gas temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature T-F for magnetic-field detunings on both the BCS and BEC sides of the resonance.},

The relationship with entanglement and Bell's theorem are analyzed, and the progress to date towards experimental confirmation of the EPR paradox is summarized, with a detailed treatment of the continuous-variable paradox in laser-based experiments. Practical techniques covered include continuous-wave parametric amplifier and optical fiber quantum soliton experiments. Current proposals for extending EPR experiments to massive-particle systems are discussed, including spin squeezing, atomic position entanglement, and quadrature entanglement in ultracold atoms. Finally, applications of this technology to quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, and entanglement swapping are e!

We also present a numerically efficient projection method for analysing correlation functions of the simulation results, and demonstrate physical examples of the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of solitons and atom number squeezing in optical lattices. },

	abstract = {We investigate the quantum many-body dynamics of dissociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecular dimers into pairs of constituent bosonic atoms and analyze the resulting atom-atom correlations. The quantum fields of both the molecules and atoms are simulated from first principles in three dimensions using the positive-P representation method. This allows us to provide an exact treatment of the molecular field depletion and s-wave scattering interactions between the particles, as well as to extend the analysis to nonuniform systems. In the simplest uniform case, we find that the major source of atom-atom decorrelation is atom-atom recombination which produces molecules outside the initially occupied condensate mode. The unwanted molecules are formed from dissociated atom pairs with nonopposite momenta. The net effect of this process---which becomes increasingly significant for dissociation durations corresponding to more than about 40\% conversion---is to!
  reduce the atom-atom correlations. In addition, for nonuniform systems we find that mode mixing due to inhomogeneity can result in further degradation of the correlation signal. We characterize the correlation strength via the degree of squeezing of particle number-difference fluctuations in a certain momentum-space volume and show that the correlation strength can be increased if the signals are binned into larger counting volumes.},

Then we show that, in general, the PPR is not restricted to a lower-dimensional subspace. Finally, we address the problem of initial conditions, which have to be chosen carefully to avoid incorrect results. More specifically, we show that the explicit form of the PPR that was given in the original existence proof leads to unphysical behavior when used as an initial distribution.},

The Dirac-Feynman path integral formalism is seen as a natural development. Several generic Markov processes are studied when extended to complex measures. The role of conditional expectations in this framework as propagating amplitudes is brought out with special reference to the Huyghens' principle. Diffusion is studied in this extended formalism and the context in which the Schrodinger or Dirac equation can be derived is stated. The Hamiltonian evolution and decay of correlations require complex measures which are boundary values of analytic functions.},

From a suitably defined auxiliary two point function we are able to identify the excited modes in the wave field. The relative simplicity of the higher order correlation functions emerge as a byproduct and the conditions under which these are made pure are derived. These results depend in a crucial manner on the notion of coherence indices and of unimodular coherence indices. A new class of approximate expressions for the density operator of a statistical wave field is worked out based on discrete characteristic sets.

This can be used for calculating correlation functions of systems of interacting stochastic fields. Such field equations can arise in the description of Hamiltonian and open systems in the physics of nonlinear processes, and may include multiplicative noise sources. The algorithm can be used for studying the properties of nonlinear quantum or classical field theories. The general approach is outlined and applied to a specific example, namely the quantum statistical fluctuations of ultra-short optical pulses in {\oe}{\'a}(2)parametric waveguides. This example uses a non-diagonal coherent state representation, and correctly predicts the sub-shot noise level spectral fluctuations observed in homodyne detection measurements. It is expected that the methods used will be applicable for higher-order c!
 orrelation functions and other physical problems as well. A stochastic differencing technique for reducing sampling errors is also introduced. This involves solving nonlinear stochastic parabolic PDEs in combination with a reference process, which uses the Wigner representation in the example presented here. A computer implementation on MIMD parallel architectures is discussed.},

Extraction of soliton pulses closer to true quantum solitons than their coherent counterparts from mode-locked lasers is possible. Moreover, it is a general method of reducing photon-number fluctuations below the shot-noise level for nonsoliton pulses as well. It is anticipated that similar reductions in particle fluctuations could occur for other forms of interfering bosonic fields whenever self-interaction nonlinearities exist, for example, interacting ultracold atoms.},
