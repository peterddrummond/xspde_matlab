xSPDE4 standards:

Methods

(1) Cell input parameters are not needed if the cell has one component
(2) Methods import and export cell arrays, and are self-describing
(3) User functions import multiple field and noise arrays, export one array 
(4) The parameter structure is always passed as the last variable
(5) Parameters have default values, so not all are required
(6) Methods may use separate derivA, derivB, derivC, derivD functions
